          In this live episode 50, Fredrik takes us on a journey through the
          history and usage of obelisks in ancient Egypt. He discusses the early
          history of obelisks, their association with the pharaohs, and their
          use as grave markers. Fredrik also talks about the sun temples
          dedicated to the sun god Ra and their resemblance to pyramid
          complexes. Additionally, he touches on the benben stone and its
          significance in ancient Egyptian mythology. Tune in to learn more
          about the unique architecture of obelisks and their role in ancient
          Egyptian culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archaeologist, or are there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 50, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. And we are, for the first time, live! As a
          celebration, this record is live-streamed. If you are listening in the
          catalog, don't be sad; you can still get the video version on YouTube.
          What will we talk about today? I'm glad you asked; I will cover an
          episode from the latest season of Ancient Aliens titled "The Power of
          the Obelisks." As the title implies, this will be a full-on episode
          about Obelisks. I'll take you through its history and usage, and in
          the end, I'll teach you how to make your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who are here and watching live, if you have questions, save
          those for the end of the stream. There, you will have an opportunity
          to ask them and most likely get an answer.

        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are back in Egypt; while the pyramids will make a quick guest
          appearance, they are not our primary focus. As previously mentioned,
          we will deal with the Obelisk. A stone pillar that could be described
          as this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Egyptian Obelisk is one of the most unique pieces of
            architecture in ancient Egypt. Every Obelisk you look at it is a
            perfect mathematical equation, geometrically perfect physics wise,
            perfect. They were always made of granite. And they were four sided
            and towered upwards and eventually ended in this perfect pyramid</em
          >."
        </p>
        <h2 id="history">The Early History of Obelisks</h2>
        <p>
          Following the pyramids, the obelisks may be one thing most people
          associate with ancient Egypt. Let's deal a little bit with the name
          for obelisks, not that it really is essential here, but a fun little
          trivia knowledge. The word for Obelisk does not originate from Egypt;
          no, it's Greek. When the Greeks traveled to Ancient Egypt, they saw
          these giant monuments; they might have been a bit hungry because they
          used the word for spit, as one might use in barbeque. The first time
          the obelisks were referred to as needles was by an Arabic physician
          and historian named Abd al-Laṭīf al-Baghdādī.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Egyptians called these monuments <em>tekhen </em>(t(kh)n) and are
          associated with sign O25 in the Gardiners sign list. Interestingly,
          the word <em>tekhen</em>, with the exact spelling, is used for
          "beating a drum" or musician.
        </p>
        <p>
          The origin of the Obelisk is a bit murky, and the earliest record of
          them being used is way back in the fourth dynasty. The Obelisk had a
          square base at the start with an isosceles at the top. During this
          time, the Obelisk seems to have been a mortuary monument.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, during the fifth dynasty, the Obelisk started to change into
          something else. It became more like the ones we know from later eras.
          Now, these were modest affairs, not more than maybe three meters tall.
          But they were now starting to be used as monoliths. Unfortunately,
          none of these earliest obelisks have been preserved until our days.
          From the records we have preserved, they seem to have been connected
          to the pharao. Meant to create a sort of connection between the king's
          ka, your spiritual double and essence, and the sun god Ra. Even if
          they had now started to get a more evolved meaning, the primary
          function was still as gravemarkers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth mentioning here is that during the fifth dynasty, around six
          pharaohs seemed to have built sun temples dedicated to the Sun god Ra.
          The shape of these closely resembles the layout of a pyramid complex,
          starting with a valley temple from where a causeway will bring you up
          to the temple courtyard. While most temples of Ancient Egypt were
          enclosed, the sun temples were not, and the altar was out in the open
          air with an obelisk-shaped construction in the courtyard. While about
          six or so of these temples were built, only two have been located. The
          temple of Niuserre and the temple of Userkaf, with the Nuiserre temple
          being the best preserved. Preserved might be a bit of a misnomer since
          both have been destroyed over the centuries. While this version of an
          Egyptian temple was only built briefly in the fifth dynasty, this
          design would get a surprising renaissance. The open-air temples with
          this form would be constructed again 1000 years later for an extremely
          short amount of time. During his reign, Amenhotep IV, maybe better
          known as Akhenaten the heretic pharao, would resurrect this design for
          his temples to Aten.
        </p>
        <h2 id="benben">The benben stone</h2>
        <p>
          Let's talk a bit about the top of the Obelisk. The pyramid shape is
          not solely for aesthetic reasons but is thought to represent the
          Benben. A common symbol in the Egyptian mythology. If we listen to the
          Ancient Alien people, they explain the meaning of the symbol like
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The pyramid shaped stone on top of each Obelisk called the Benben
            Stone, was a design rooted in Egyptian mythology. The Benben was a
            vehicle which autumn, the god of all creation, used to travel back
            and forth between the heavens and earth. We think of the Benben as a
            craft because it is believed to have come from the stars.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are into Egyptian mythology or history, this account might
          leave you a little bit confused. The benben stone is, in Egyptian
          mythology, the first piece of land that rose from the primordial
          waters and became the place from where Aten, in most cases, created
          the world. However, Egyptian religion was not formalized or
          standardized as Christianity, Islam, or other religions today. The
          creation stories would differ depending on your city because they
          wanted to promote their patron diets. So, while the mound was
          associated with Atum/Ra in Heliopolis, the Sun city, this would not be
          the case in Memphis. Other gods were more important there, so if we
          were able to ask the local Memphians, they would claim the mound was
          first inhabited by Tatenen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea that the benben would be an otherworldly object is prevalent
          in pseudo-scientific circles. As far as I've been able to track it
          down, it seems to originate from the Ancient Alien proponent Robert
          Bauval. To Bauval's credit, he does not suggest in his text that the
          benben was a spaceship; Robert suggests it was a meteorite. Within the
          Temple of Ra in Heliopolis, there's supposed to have been a benben
          stone that was the original primordial mound. It's, of course, been
          lost to history, but Bauval suggests that this would then have been a
          meteorite. While it's plausible that a meteorite might have set up as
          a place of worship is plausible, there's not enough evidence that it
          was so. As we also covered a mere moment ago, each city would want to
          claim the primordial mound as their own. But I don't argue that
          meteoric iron was unimportant in Ancient Egypt. As I discuss in
          episode 43, "<a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-43-aliens-metallurgy.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Aliens and Heavy Metall-urgy</a
          >," meteoric iron was used in Egyptian ironwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it does not make much sense that the benben would be from space if
          we look at the mythological records. The creation story of Ancient
          Egypt draws its inspiration from the overflowing of the Nile, as we
          see with the elements of primordial water and the mound rising up from
          it. So, to sum up, the benben is not an Ancient Egyptian description
          of a spaceship but a modern reimagination of the mythology.
        </p>

        <h2 id="use">The use of Obelisks</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back to our exploration of Obelisks. So, where in the world do
          you find the most Obelisks? If you said Rome, I definitely want you on
          my bar trivia team because it is correct. While in Rome, you can go
          around and find 13 Obelisks; the Romans sure did like to use them as
          decorations in the Hippodrome. We will get to how you can move these
          monoliths a bit later. I want to shift a little bit back and look at
          the meaning of the obelisks we can still see today. We discussed the
          early purpose and use of the Obelisk as a mortuary object. However,
          did this practice stay the same if we look at those we still have
          preserved now scattered around the globe? If we listen to the Ancient
          Alien crowd, the meaning of the Obelisks are as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Most hieroglyphs that are on the obelisks are always the king
            asking the gods to be there for him on his journey through the
            afterlife so they can arrive to the afterlife and live for
            immortality. And the top was always dedicated to the sun.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          If we repeat the previous question about where to find the most
          Obelisks, change it slightly to where we found the most Obelisks in
          Egypt? Where would that be? In this case, the answer would be the city
          Iunu ( 𓉺𓏌𓊖 - <em>jwnw</em>), maybe better known by its Hellenistic
          name, Heliopolis. The obelisks we see today are the Middle Kingdom
          and, to some extent, the New Kingdom phenomenon. The oldest Obelisk in
          this new form is from Sesostris I, who reigned from 1908 to 1875 BCE.
          It's one of the few that stands in its original location, in this
          case, Heliopolis. So you can still see it today there while,
          interestingly, nothing is really left of the temple. But as you can
          guess from the location, the Obelisks in the New Kingdom were not
          mortuary commemoration but more for bragging. The Egyptian temples
          were already giant propaganda billboards, and with the obelisks, you
          got some more room to brag.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the Obelisk, Sensostris writes the regular stuff, how he is the sun
          of Horus and all the other gods, the king of upper and lower Egypt,
          etc. But we actually learn when he erected the Obelisk. Toward the end
          of the text, it's written, "The first occasion of the Jubilee, he made
          it to live forever." So Jubilee, in this case, refers to the heb-fest.
          The rejuvenation ritual was performed by tradition around the 30th
          year of the Pharaos reign. So we know the Obelisk was erected in 1878
          BCE. I have the full-text translation from Sensostris I Obelisk in
          Heliopolis on the webpage if you want to read more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sensostris apparently didn't get the memo of what's supposed to be on
          an Obelisk. But he could just be an outlier; Sensotris put up another
          monument that's more like a giant stele, an Obelisk with a rounded
          top. It's quite an unconventional monument, so let's look at what some
          other Obelisks say. So, let's look at another example from Thutmose
          III and what's known today as the Lateran Obelisk.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lateran obelisk was first placed in Karnak, but in 357 CE, it was
          moved to Rome, where it would decorate the spina in Circus Maximus.
          Today, you will find it on the square outside the Archbasilica of St.
          John Lateran in Rome. If we start reading on the top at the pyramidion
          or Benben stone, we can read the following passage on the west side.
        </p>
        <p><em>Pyramidion: THOTHMES III received by AmeN-Ra.</em></p>
        <p><em>"Amen, Tum."</em></p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The good god, Ra-MEN-KHEPER, giver of life like the Sun,
            immortal"</em
          >
        </p>
        <p><em>Thothmes III kneeling to Amen-Ra seated on a throne.</em></p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The King Ra-MEN-KHEPER, Son of the Sun, Thothmes (III), like the
            Sun, immortal, gives wine."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p><em>/&hellip;/</em></p>
        <p>
          <em
            >The HAR-EM-AKHU, the living Sun, the strong Bull, crowned by Truth,
            Ra-MEN-KHEPER, who adores the splendor of Amen in Thebes, Amen
            welcomes him in his heart dilates at the memorials of his Son,
            increasing his kingdom as he wishes, he gives stability and cycles
            to his Lord, making millions of festivals of thirty years, the Son
            of the Sun, THOTHMES (III), uniting existence (giver of life).</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, not really asking the gods for eternal life. It does not
          improve if we read what's written on the different sides. Most of it
          is just Thutmose bragging about various things he has achieved. One
          thing I find a little heartwarming here is the message that was carved
          at a later stage by Thutmose IV.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Now His Majesty completed the very great sole obelisk from what his
            ancestor the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Men-kheperre (Thutmose
            III) brought after His Majesty found this obelisk having lain for a
            total of 35 years on its side in the possession of the craftsmen on
            the south side of Karnak.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          So, it seems the project had been halted for one reason. This also
          gives us some insight into how the Egyptians constructed the Obelisks.
          We will return to this in a little bit. For now, let's turn our
          attention toward another Obelisk to see if we can find this elusive
          idea about the Ancient Alien claim about these monuments. So let's
          look at Ramses II, or Ramses the Great, one of the more famous
          pharaohs who ended up reigning until he was 90. It's said he had about
          100 children, and a less flattering nickname for him among
          Egyptologists is "the great chisler." Ramses had a bit of a habit of
          chiseling out other pharaoh names and replacing the cartouche with his
          own. But on the Luxor Obelisk now found in Paris, we can read, for
          example, that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Kingly Horus, Strong Bull, Son of Tum, the King of Upper and
            Lower Egypt, the Lord of Diadems, who protects and chastises the
            nations. Son of the Sun. Ramsessou Meriamen, king, warlike, who has
            acted with his own hands, in the face of the whole earth, the Lord
            of the Two lands.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          So it continues on the obelisks from the Middle Kingdom and the New
          Kingdom. They changed from mortuary markers, that might not have had
          any inscriptions, to large propaganda poles. While the goal, in a
          sense, was to achieve immortality, this was not the primary objective
          of the texts. The main purpose seems to have been propaganda when
          reading the texts, with some religion weaved into it. But they seemed
          to complement the temple walls that were also heavy on propaganda. It
          might be good to remember that faith and propaganda can be mixed
          together.
        </p>
        <h2 id="creating">Creating an Obelisk</h2>
        <p>
          I'm sure many of you are here mainly because you wonder how the
          Ancient Egyptians created these monoliths. I won't keep you waiting
          any longer for that. When alternative historians and alien conspiracy
          believers talk about the construction of Egyptian monuments, we often
          hear some claim that sounds like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >This is not the work of primitive people who have copper
            chisels.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          We often hear this claim that copper chisels can't be used to dress
          granite stone. This statement is never followed up by any sort of
          evidence or test. An interesting tidbit is that when people have tried
          to see if it's possible to use copper tools, the answer is that copper
          works. For example, one experimental stone mason named Mickael Restoin
          shows that getting a smooth granite surface with nothing more than a
          copper chisel and a grindstone to eliminate the tool marks is
          possible. Restoin has even developed a chisel technique so it doesn't
          get dull as fast and lasts longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also fits in quite well with the Ancient Egyptian's depictions of
          stone workers. For example, in the mastaba of Kaemrehu, we can see a
          relief of workers creating a Ka statue using copper chisels. In the
          picture, it even looks as if their tools have wood handles; combined
          with the archaeological find of copper chisels, it's pretty clear that
          this was one method they incorporated into their stone masonry. One
          method does not mean the only method. An experimental archaeologist,
          Denys Stocks, has made a good case for stone tools used in Egyptian
          stonework.
        </p>
        <p>
          One issue with copper tools is that they are soft, and there are still
          questions about whether they can get those sharp edges on granite
          stones we see in hieroglyph carvings. Stocks have suggested that they
          might have used stone chisels to get these charming edges. By
          utilizing these stone chisels, the idea is that you can get these
          sharp edges we often see in Egyptian stonework. Something that's
          turned out to be true. When trying the stone chisels, mainly made out
          of flint, the result was an exact match. These experiments have also
          been replicated in<a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-45-pumapunku-tiwanaku.html"

          >
            Andean archaeology by Protzen and Nazzir</a
          >, who tried tools out of flint, obsidian, and other stones to
          replicate the stonework at Pumapunku. This is an excellent example of
          how we, with ingenuity, can discover alternative methods that would
          fit within the era's technology. With all this in mind, let's discard
          the idea that the Ancient Egyptians were primitive and that these
          things were impossible with copper chisels.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a few misconceptions regarding Egyptian stonework out of our way,
          let's move on to how we create an Obelisk. Do you remember the first
          quote where we heard that Obelisks are always made of granite? Let me
          address this, or maybe dress this, claim. While most Obelisks are
          granite, some are also created from sandstone and other rocks. It's
          just a little disclaimer. I could not stop myself from pointing this
          out. For now, let's shift back to the granite Obelisk. Almost all were
          quarried at Aswan, a location in the south of Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the Ancient Egyptians did not leave a detailed written
          record behind regarding how they created these monuments. But we can
          piece things together thanks to the unfinished Obelisk still in the
          Aswan Quary, the scarce sources, and the archaeological record.
          There's also new research giving us additional information on how they
          could have quarried these giant stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, a foreman would find a good spot that did not show signs of
          cracking. They likely excavated down a little to ensure no hidden
          flaws. But with the Obelisk marked out, the workers could get to work
          starting to pound out the pillar from the bedrock. No copper chisels
          were used in this part of the process; instead, they used a dolorite
          ball that they dropped or threw. Slowly chipping away flakes of
          minerals and stone from the rock. A repetitive and slow task that
          would most likely have taken a toll on the worker's health. Fine dust
          and other particles would have filled the trench they worked in,
          getting drawn into the workers' lungs. We know that these dolorite
          balls were used due to the number of them we found in the quarries.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the pounding with dolerite balls is a viable explanation, recent
          research indicates that the Ancient Egyptians had more tools
          available. In a 2014 paper, Tom Heldal and Per Storemyr suggest that
          the Egyptians utilized fire in the quarries. Using fire to mine or
          excavate stone and minerals has been used throughout history.
          Egyptologists have reported fire signs in the quarries since the early
          1900s. Reginald Engelbach, for example, mentions that in the 1920s,
          burnt granite could be picked up almost everywhere. By applying heat,
          you weaken the strength of the granite. The drawback is that you must
          be careful and pay attention to the stone's porosity, structure, and
          keep track of micro-cracks. When the controlled fire has burned out,
          you can start to pound the granite with your dolorite balls, with a
          bit lighter work ahead of you. On the unfinished Obelisk in Aswan, we
          can see the marks of these dolorite pounders that have created long
          individual grooves. These appear from the pounding with the dolorite
          pounders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the different quarries around Egypt, Storemyr and Heldal
          have been able to differentiate three methods for quarrying. As we
          just discussed, fire and pounding create parallel flakes with spalling
          and, of course, using preexisting cracks to their advantage when
          quarrying. However, these methods require workers with more skills,
          but on the other hand, it allow for a smaller workforce. So, earlier
          ideas that this was slave labor might not be accurate with this new
          information. More research is required in this area to better
          understand Egyptian quarry methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's unknown exactly how long it took to create one Obelisk, but we
          have one written account giving us an estimate. Hatsetsup wrote on the
          base of one of her obelisks that she quarried as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >My majesty ordered them to be made in year 15 (of Hatshepsut's
            rule), the second month of winter, on the first day, until year 16,
            fourth month, last day (when they were finished). The work has
            lasted 7 months since the arrangements in the mountain.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          So, according to Hatsetsup, it took her 7 months to create the two
          Obelisks. Hatsetsup didn't hold back either, and these are among the
          larger pylons, so that one could build these in less than a year is
          not an estimate out of the question.
        </p>
        <h2 id="moving">Moving an Obelisk</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back! Now that we know how the obelisks were quarried, what's
          written on them, and their history, I'll now get into how they were
          moved. Many of these are not small things; they are, in fact, quite
          large, and it's a fair question to ask how this was achieved. Some
          explanations are more possible, and there are suggestions such as
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >We have some references in ancient Egyptian texts that also speak
            of some of these obelisks being levitated and the way that worked is
            that a magical white powder had to be strewn across the stones and
            then water was added and through some quote unquote magical
            incantations, then those rocks lifted themselves and they could
            levitate into place</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll get into where this claim originates since this story is
          fascinating. This is also an excellent example of the importance of
          source criticism. I will start with how we mainstream archaeologists
          explain how ancient Egyptians moved these giant monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you needed to get the quarried obelisks out of its hole. We are
          not entirely sure how it was done, but it seems to have been possible
          using ropes and levers. It could also be that they used a similar
          technology as construction worker Wally Wallington, who raised blocks
          weighing 9000 kg on his own with only sticks and gravity. But the
          Obelisk was later dragged down to the water when it was out from the
          quarry. The workers seem to have prepped the way down with fire and
          pounders to create a smooth surface where they could more easily drag
          the stone. They most likely used sleds, as seen in Djehutihote's tomb.
          Depicted on the wall is how several workmen move a giant statue on a
          sled, pouring some liquid out in front of it to decrease friction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that the Obelisks were then loaded onto barges and sent down
          the Nile. Since the Nile flows north, they barely had to use sails;
          the current would be enough to move the pillars up the river. This is
          also depicted in reliefs in Egypt. The earliest depiction of using
          boats to move large stone objects is from the 5th dynasty and King
          Unas Causeway. In that depiction, we see large pillars transported by
          boat; we also know it's heading north since the sails aren't up.
          That's an excellent way to see in what direction a ship is traveling
          in Egyptian art. If the sails are up, they use the southbound winds
          heading to Upper Egypt. If the sails are down, they go by current
          toward Lower Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have not only King Una's causeway; Hatsetsup details how the boats
          were constructed and used on a relief at her temple. She wrote how she
          got sycamore trees from the whole land to build the ships. Then, it
          details how soldiers and sailors were conscripted and how everyone
          celebrated as the giant Obelisks arrived at Karnak. Something that
          seems to be forgotten in discussions about this relief is that the
          Obelisks sit on top sleds while on the boats. This is also visible in
          Unas Causeway.
        </p>
        <p>
          That stone blocks were moved by boat on the Nile is also corroborated
          by other officials within Egyptian society. Going all the way back to
          the 4th dynasty and the construction of the Khufu's pyramid as
          described in the diary of Merer. There are mentions of the
          construction of Obelisks in the mortuary biography of Innis, an
          architect serving Amenhotep I, and Thutmose I. Hatsetsup's favorite
          official, Senmut, also talks about the construction of the Obelisks.
          None of these texts, however, mention anything about some supernatural
          power to move them. Just manpower, cunning, and resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          In later periods, we also have the Ptolemaic dynasty, who started to
          move obelisks from Heliopolis and Karnak to Alexandria, where they
          resided. Then we have the Romans who thought the Obelisks would look
          super rad in the Hippodrome and then moved them across the
          Mediterranean to Rome and other places. While the Romans had access to
          ropes, pulleys, and other technologies, they were not dabbling with
          modern machinery. At best, it most likely just cut back the manpower
          you needed to move these giant pylons. We also have accounts of the
          1500s in Rome when they moved and erected these monuments after the
          Obelisks had fallen and been lost for some time. We have depictions of
          how the Italians moved and lifted these without machinery, with only
          ropes and pulleys. Again, this is before steam engines and modern
          machinery. But nobody is claiming that the Romans or later Italians
          required alien assistance to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          These monuments were an achievement to move. That's why all pharaohs
          talk about them in such high esteem. They were meant to display their
          power and wealth combined with being a monument of the religion.
          Moving these giant monoliths is an achievement even in our days; both
          the New York Obelisks and the London Obelisks were transported with
          some difficulty from Egypt. The one in New York, also known as
          Cleopatra's needle, took Henry Gorringe to transport from Egypt to the
          USA about a year. This endeavor was quite the harrowing tale that
          would be a great movie, to be honest. While it was difficult, Gorringe
          required far less manpower than the Egyptians and had a smaller budget
          to work with.
        </p>
        <p>
          One mystery not entirely solved is how the ancient Egyptians got the
          Obelisk up on the pedestal. They most likely built a mound where they
          dragged the monolith up and then just let it slide down the other end
          of the pedestal. There's one rumor surviving to our day where it's
          claimed that Ramses II had one of his kids tied to the top of the
          Obelisk to ensure the workmen did this extra carefully. I'm not
          entirely sure about that claim, and I also just want to throw out
          there that Ramses had some 100 children. But with everything else we
          have discussed, we don't need modern technology or aliens for the
          Egyptians to do this. We have just not needed to solve this issue for
          a long time, and they never wrote down how they did it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we close this episode out, I want to discuss where Tsoukalos
          got the claim about the magic powder. It is not as you might suspect
          from any records in Ancient Egypt, but a 1999 book by Laurence Gardner
          titled "Genesis of the Grail Kings." Gardner is the origin of the
          claim and seems to have created this narrative by misquoting the book
          "<em>Inscriptions of Sinai Vol 2</em>" and "<em
            >Researches in Sinai.</em
          >" Laurence claims these books mention a substance he calls "mfkzt" or
          "mufkuzt." This is supposed to be mono-atomic gold in a white powder
          form that has next to supernatural properties. As I mentioned, this is
          just made up, and "mfkzt" has no meaning in the Egyptian language.
          This does not stop people from claiming this is real, referring to
          other sources like the German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius, who also
          never mentioned this in his writing. These claims started when it was
          hard to double-check this stuff since the books are relatively obscure
          and old. Today, however, they are digitalized and widely available

          On that note, I will end episode 50. Next time, I'll have a guest, and

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.
