          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 44, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we will look at the origin of the
          Grey aliens. We will learn this is a modern creation, but don't turn
          it off yet because there will be some exciting twists and turns along
          the way.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We start far from the world of archaeology with the abduction of Betty
          and Barney Hill. We will look into alien abductions, their
          commonalities, and how we can explain many of these experiences. We
          will also learn some interesting things about the case.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we will hunt for historical examples of Grey aliens. During this
          travel, we will visit the Hopi people and discuss their society and
          religion, which can all be seen in their practice of creating Kachina
          figures. From there, we move on to Peru, where we will discuss
          pyramids, elongated skulls, and ancient DNA. We will also disprove
          Brien Foerster's DNA analysis he performed a couple of years
          ago.&nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="hill">The Case on the Hill</h2>
        <p>
          We start this episode with the famous case of Roswell, a topic we
          discussed with Blake Smith from Monstertalk in episode 9. I do not
          have something to add currently to this case since it's pretty clear
          that it was a weather balloon, and Brian Dunning over at Skeptoid has
          done some fantastic research into the Roswell claims. Due to this,
          I'll leave this subject for now; we need to have things to return to
          later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next is a topic I struggle with, not really how to explain the
          phenomenon but how to tactfully approach it. The subject is Alien
          abductees, often referred to as alien abduction experience or AAE in
          research articles. We will return to this subject with a psychologist
          when some schedules align with the stars. I will softly start by
          dealing with this topic since it's quite a recurring topic, and what
          they say in this episode is not, well, in comparison, harmful.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with the maybe most famous example they bring up, the
          Barney and Betty Hill incident. A tale that inspired episodes on
          X-files and a movie starring James Earl Jones and Estelle Parsons in
          the lead. This case is usually described as "the first known UFO
          abduction," something that is not true. Earlier accounts are, for
          example, Elizabeth Klarer, who tells about being abducted in the
          1950s. Then we have Ant&ocirc;nio Vilas Boas, a Brazilian farmer who
          claims to have been kidnapped in 1957. If you want to hear more about
          Ant&ocirc;nios's story, check out the member/Patreon version.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The story about what is claimed to have happened to Barney and Betty
          starts on September 19, 1961. The couple was driving back to their
          home in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, from a vacation in Niagara Falls
          and Montreal. The couple had stopped for a late dinner in Colebrook,
          New Hampshire, from where they left around 10 PM. It was the last
          stretch of the journey in their 1957 Chevrolet Bel Air; the air was
          warm, and the heavens were clear. As they went down US Route 3, Betty
          saw something and urged Barney to stop the car. Barney parked the car
          at a rest stop, and the couple watched a luminous object on the
          far-off horizon. Betty, convinced it was an unidentified flying
          object, fervently declared her belief, while Barney remained
          skeptical, insisting it was nothing more than a commercial airplane en
          route to Montreal. Betty's previous encounter with a UFO through her
          sister a few years prior had perhaps influenced her conviction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The couple is then claimed to have witnessed the light as they
          continue their journey until the light forces them to stop in the
          middle of the highway. Barney described "humanoid" looking creatures
          with glossy black uniforms and hats, which were kind of leather-like.
          According to Betty, Barney gets concerned about their safety at one
          point, and while shouting, "They're going to capture us," he jumps in
          the car, and they speed off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is the story the couple initially told to the National
          Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena, NICAP. An independent
          UFO research group formed in 1950 and lasted into the 80s. The Hills
          reported their sighting a few days after to Richard Hall, who involved
          the group's investigator Walter Webb. An interview took place in
          October 1961 and lasted for about six hours. You might rightly point
          out here that this account does not include any grey aliens or an
          abduction. Or, as Jason Martell puts it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The beings described by Betty and Barney Hill fit the classic case of
          a Grey. Now, there are variations to size and dimensions of these
          beings, but they all seem to have the same characteristics: Slim,
          spindly bodies; large, oval heads; large, oversized eyes." - Jason
          Martell.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are elements that aren't added until almost two years later.
          After this experience, Betty Hill started to have nightmares and
          journal these dreams. She then reworked her accounts and rewrote her
          journals and experiences for almost two and a half years. One copy,
          however, was provided to Walter Webb in November 1961. In 1964, the
          Hills had agreed to undergo hypnosis to recover memories as a part of
          a treatment for their anxiety led by Dr. Benjamin Simon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Simon has maybe gotten the short end of the stick in the public
          reimagination of the story. More often than not, he is just referred
          to as a hypnotist; Dr. Simon, however, was the head of neuropsychiatry
          at the Army's psychiatric center, Mason General Hospital. There, Dr.
          Simon was involved in researching what then was called shell shock,
          today more known as PTSD. Within this research, Dr. Simon experimented
          with hypnosis to relieve soldiers' stress. Hypnosis is, while
          surrounded by magical claims, a real thing. In clinical studies on
          pain relief, patients who have been hypnotized report that the
          hypnosis helped them with their pain. Even better results can be found
          in stress management among susceptible patients. I say susceptible
          since hypnosis doesn't work on everyone. The technique most used today
          was developed at Stanford and includes a sliding scale called Stanford
          Hypnotic Susceptibility Scales. So, everyone fits on this scale that
          ranges from 0 to 12. From not susceptible to entirely susceptible.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is in the couple's anxiety and being interracial we find Dr.
          Simons's reason for being involved in this. As he points out in his
          foreword to John G. Fuller's book "The interupted Journey," what
          interested Dr. Simon was not the UFO story but "Mr. and Mrs. Hill
          presented-crippling anxiety, manifested by him in fairly open fashion
          and by Mrs. Hill more in the form of repetitive nightmarish dreams."
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading Dr. Simons's account, he doesn't take much stock in what the
          couple says during the hypnosis. Dr. Simon theorized that the couple
          could unlock the amnesia quicker than through traditional therapy. He
          does point out that while being hypnotized, you can still make things
          up and does not seem to take what the couple says as truth. Today, we
          know that this form of "regressed memory theory" doesn't really have
          any effect and that most patients just tell an imagined version of
          what happened. Dr. Simon doesn't discuss this, but it's a bit of
          hindsight 20/20 on that. The doctor intended to use the hypnosis
          sessions as a part of a more extensive therapy for the apparent stress
          presented by the couple.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to add that some of Barney's stress seems related to his
          experience as an Afro-American in the white culture of 1960. Within
          the recordings, he often talks about his fear of being subjugated to
          racist acts. Not unfounded at all; it had just been a few years since
          the lynching of Emmet Till in Mississippi. Barney gives insight into
          his concerns while doing simple things like renting a room, entering a
          restaurant, or walking in the park. Will they be accepted, face
          racism, and rejection, or what will happen in these situations?
          Something that I believe many people of color are still struggling
          with today.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Within these recordings of the therapy sessions, most of the abduction
          story people know is documented. All the medical experiments, the star
          maps, and the grey alien look more or less originate here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth mentioning is that how the aliens looked changed quite a bit
          through the years. From the original leather-wearing humanoid figures
          as initially reported, Betty then describes them as short humans with
          black hair and Jimmy Durante noses. Barney, however, depicts the
          creatures at first a bit differently. Looking out a window is not an
          extraterrestrial being but a red-headed Irishman. Dr. Simon asked why
          he thought the alien looked Irish, and Barney answered:
        </p>
        <p>
          "I think I know why. Because Irish are usually hostile to n-word. And
          when I see a friendly Irish person, I react to him by thinking&mdash;I
          will be friendly. And I think this one that is looking over his
          shoulder is friendly."

          The Irishman turns into a German Nazi with a scarf and leather jacket.
          However, later, during the hypnosis, Barney starts to depict them as
          thin, grey, with large black eyes, and bald, which Betty will also
          pick up on afterward. Interestingly, as Brian Dunning points out, in
          April 1962, Twilight episode 30 of season 3 aired, titled "Hocus-Pocus
          and Frisby." In it, we encounter a monster that fits Hill's depiction
          of the grey aliens almost a bit too well.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's fascinating here is how the story evolved from the strange
          light in the sky to the full-fledged AAE. Maybe even more interesting
          is that neither Walter Webb nor Dr. Simon believes the abduction part
          of the account.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there a way to explain these sightings and experiences? Well, it
          depends. For the strange lights in the sky, it's hard to say precisely
          what it was since we can't often go back and see it. The term UFO
          doesn't necessarily mean alien spacecraft but something in the sky
          that we have yet to identify. A few things have been suggested for the
          Hills flying objects they saw; the most common one is that it was
          Venus they saw. I find that explanation a bit lackluster. A better
          answer was presented in 2007 by the Macdonald family. They tried to
          re-create the light and drow down Route 3 during the day and at night.
          During the night, they did manage to see a light following them. On
          closer examination, they noticed that it corresponded with the
          location of the observation tower on top of Cannon Mountain. The tower
          had a bright light on top and, from the looks of things, was a good
          candidate for what the Hills saw.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the tower was torn down in 2008 and replaced with a new
          one in 2011 with a less bright light. No recent UFO sightings have
          been reported of late on this stretch of Route 3.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          How about the alien encounters, then? How do we explain the
          abductions? Here, it would have been even better with a psychologist
          present, but there are several explanations behind the AAE. Some will
          relate to Betty's nightmares, which we have already discussed.
          Something often left out of these stories is that the abductees are
          sleeping. Betty Hills' abduction came from dreams after researching
          the UFO phenomenon. Within the episode, they interview another person
          who claims to have had an AAE, Kim Carlsberg. I don't want to get too
          deep into her story, but Kim claims to have seen a strange light, went
          to bed, and was abducted. I don't want to go deeper into Kim's story
          because she is clearly in distress, but instead of getting help to
          deal with the stress these dreams give her properly, she is taken
          advantage of by the media.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many of these cases, sleep paralysis is the most likely cause of
          these experiences. We go through different stages during sleep,
          including the so-called REM (or rapid eye movement) stage. During this
          stage, we often have our dreams, and as a safety mechanism, the body
          locks up to stop you from acting out your dream. In some cases, people
          can become aware during this stage. Referred to as "awareness during
          sleep paralysis" or ASP. During the ASP, your body is paralyzed and in
          a dream-like state. In this state, about 40% of persons with ASP have
          auditory hallucinations, and 30% report visual. These hallucinations
          seem to be culturally influenced. In the past, demons or ghosts were
          the culprits. In Slavic countries, for example, you might have been
          visited by Vjek, but in other parts of Europe, it might have been the
          Succubus. These religious or folkloric elements seem in our society to
          become replaced by Aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleep paralysis is not the only sleep-related explanation. A study by
          Dr. Wamsley et al. shows that 80% of people suffering from narcolepsy
          report dream delusions. The dreams feel so real that people can't
          differentiate between what's been a dream and what's not. Some of the
          alien abductions can be found here. Then, we have a Russian study from
          2021 where the authors show that people with lucid dreaming and other
          REM-sleep states could force an AAE experience.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, dreams could be a reasonable explanation for many of these
          sightings. But there are more hypotheses, such as psychopathology. I
          can see why some would think those reporting AAE are mentally ill, but
          we should be careful and respectful regarding mental illness. While
          some reports might be due to a psychopathological disturbance, studies
          don't see more mental health issues among AAE reporters than the
          typical populations. So, I'd be cautious to use this explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there's the idea of false memories. When people have an
          experience they can't explain or the very loose symptoms of alien
          abductions, such as missing time, muscle pain, or headaches. Symptoms
          that are very common in the human experience. They seek out
          self-proclaimed experts outside the medical and scientific fields.
          There, they undergo regressed memory therapies and other
          pseudoscientific methods that plant these fantasies as actual
          memories.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It has also been suggested by Dr. Newman and others that abductions
          are a way to escape one's self-using machoism. To elude the stress and
          everyday life, these people create a machoism fantasy or reality where
          they disconnect from themself. Many of the descriptions from AAE
          reports include things that could be viewed as masochistic activities.
          We see in the reports a removal of control, humiliation, and
          infliction of pain. All items that often are integral parts of the
          machoism experience. Newman and Baumeister suggest that the alien
          abduction proponents, media, and other sources have created the raw
          material for these masochistic fantasies that turn into AAE
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other explanations are that the report is a pure hoax, something worth
          keeping in mind that some, of course, will use AAE as a way to fame.
          Most likely, many of these AAE result from one or more of these
          explanations. Something worth remembering is that many of those
          reporting an AAE are victims. Many have been taken advantage of by
          repressed memory experts and UFO book authors. Instead of getting the
          help many need to alleviate the stress, they are fed a false narrative
          that often worsens their anxiety. This is visible in the interviews
          with Kim during the episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least we know a bit more, and maybe even more importantly, we have
          found the true origin of the Grey aliens. They are an invention to
          some extent based on TV shows and the hypnosis of Barney Hill. That's
          basically the end of the Grey alien origin, but the Ancient Alien show
          needed to fill out some 30 more minutes and will therefore look for
          historical evidence of grey aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="kachina">Kachina spirits</h2>
        <p>
          Let's move into an area that is a bit more related to archaeology,
          maybe not that much, though. We are back with the Hopi tribe, a nation
          connected to the Pueblo people and part of the Uto-Azteca. It is not
          the first time we have visited the Hopi people or the subject Giorgio
          brings up here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "The translation for the word Kachina is very simple. It means
          teacher. The Kachina were not a part of the spiritual world, but they
          were, in fact, a part of the physical world. They descended from the
          sky in what the Hopi refer to as fiery shields. They would touch down
          on Earth, spend time with human beings, teach them, give them
          knowledge, and then they would use the same "shields" to fly back into
          the sky." - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is one thing that actually makes me a bit frustrated with these
          Ancient Alien experts. They don't even bother using a dictionary.
          Sure, it's like ten years since Giorgio said this in tape. But
          dictionaries for the Hopi language have been in print for some time. I
          used two, "A Concise Hopi and English Lexicon," published in 1985, and
          the Hopi dictionary from Arizona University Press, published in 1998.
          Neither of these translates Kachina to the word teacher. The word for
          teacher is tutuqaynaqa. Kachina or Katsina is translated to a spirit
          being. In a way, it's a type of god to make a crude analogy. But why
          are we talking about these spirit beings? Well, in part, it's due to
          the depictions of these spirits; Ancient Astronaut theorists claim
          that they look like aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Hopi have for a long time depicted the Katsina as a type of doll
          created from the cottonwood root. They have a fascinating design with
          what looks like a helmet on top; due to a somewhat Rorschachuesk
          practice, the alien proponents claim these beings to be aliens. The
          Katsinas are depicted both in rock art and as dolls. The term doll may
          be a bit of a misnomer; while it's, in a sense, a toy, it is much more
          in the Hopi tradition.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand the doll, we must sort out what a Kachina is. Something
          more complex than one might think. Within the Hopi and Pueblo people,
          we have the Katsina represented in three ways: first, the spiritual
          being that lives in the collective mind of the people of Pueblo.
          Secondly, these beings are impersonated by people who dress as spirits
          with the help of masks. Thirdly, we find these impersonators depicted
          as dolls given to girls in ceremonies.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Katsina spirits are also split up into a couple of different
          classes. The maybe most important is the Chief or Mong Katsina. Each
          clan would own at least one impersonation of these spirits, and only
          one person, either by heritage or election, can impersonate this
          spirit. There are about 30 of the Mong Kachina; often, the clans have
          one or two connected to them specifically as a sort of supernatural
          partner or wuye. These Mong Kachinas also have different parts in the
          Hopi people's more vital ceremonies, such as Soyal, Powamu, and Niman.
          One spirit that's always present in these festivals is Eototo, a
          representation of the village chief. These ceremonies often take the
          shape of dancing and processions in the villages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another class is the guardians and warriors. Some are almost equal in
          status to one of the Mong Kachinas but still in a different standing.
          The role of these spirits is to safeguard the Mong class and to
          protect the ceremonies from witchcraft. One or two guards usually
          flanked the rear in the procession and dances to keep the dancers
          safe.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A third class is the ogres and cannibals or the Sosoyok't. Their
          function is to scare children into conformity in the village. If a
          child strays from the proper path, they are brought in front of these
          rather scary beings who will talk to them to set them back on the
          right track. This particular group seems to be borrowed from the Zuni
          people.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The list could continue, and we have not brought up the clowns,
          animals, or non-danced kachinas. There are some 200 recognized and
          documented kachinas within the Hopi tradition. Each has its place and
          function within the belief.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To get back to the dolls, they are based on the impersonators'
          costumes, so it's not a helmet the doll has but a mask. In many cases,
          the dolls are supposed to be made by the father in the family, but if
          time is lacking, it seems okay to buy one. The Katchina doll is then
          presented as a gift from the father to his daughter, but the Kachina
          impersonator hands it out. The question is why this tradition takes
          form. The answer might be among the most popular Kachinas that are
          handed out, the Powamu or the Bean Dance, and Niman, the Home dance.
          Both are connected to agricultural and fertility rites.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Hopi tradition, life is, above all, the most good. As
          bringers of life, woman in Hopi society has a special place. The dolls
          could be gifted to ensure that food and other blessings multiply. As
          women, the Kachinas are bringers of life. The children are often told
          that what the Kachina touches will multiply. But at the same time, the
          dolls are not sacred objects themself in that sense. No rituals,
          songs, or anything else are connected to creating a Kachina doll. They
          seem to exist on a plane of being both a sacred object and a child toy
          to some extent.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, the girls get their dolls; boys usually get a bow
          and arrow from their father. Interestingly, warfare and childbearing
          seem to be talked about in the same way&mdash;both activities, which
          might not be the best word, incorporate blood and a life-threatening
          danger. The purification rites are remarkably similar between the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          The women in the Hopi culture genuinely have a different status than
          many other cultures. It is the woman who's head of the house; the man
          who moves in with the woman's family when they marry. If there's any
          surplus of food or other items, these belong to the woman. As we note
          here, the Kachina dolls are far more complex than what we see in
          Ancient Aliens. This tradition is an integral part of the Hopi society
          and symbolism that connects the whole culture like a spiderweb. The
          meaning of the Kachina doll is found in the Hopi kinship, spirits, and
          their view of the natural world. As we often see, the simple alien
          theories don't fit within the larger construct of society.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I have not forgotten about Giorgio's claims about firey shields. I
          could not find any reference to the fire, but this is in the Hopi
          tongue called paatuwvota. It can translate to a flying shield or
          ripples on the water. What Giorgio is not mentioning is that shamans
          often use these shields to traverse to the heaven spirits and that
          they are made out of cotton and woven like a wedding dress. There are
          also a few other flying things like gourdes when specific spirits sit
          on them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the Hopi traditions are not evidence for Grey aliens existing
          before Hill's hypnosis. But are we saving the best evidence for last?
          Could DNA evidence prove this hypothesis right?
        </p>
        <h2>Mysteries of Peru</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Peru. Could it be that evidence of historic Grey Aliens is
          found here? Let's hear the claim from David Childress.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "One of the things that you see around the pyramids, here on coastal
          Peru, is that they're associated with these skulls. It would seem that
          those elongated skulls were half-alien, half-human. And in fact, some
          of the recent DNA testing that's been done, here in Peru, is
          indicating that these people are, somehow, half-human and half some
          other race." &ndash; David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there is a bunch of things going on here. We have pyramids, we have
          elongated skulls, and we have DNA testing. What we don't have is a
          time and place; we know it's Peru and in the coastal region. But Peru
          is quite large, and we don't know what time period we're in. This
          vagueness, I believe, is intended; this way, Childress can connect the
          origin of the pyramids with the aliens, and if the aliens visited,
          they could have mated with humans. As we know by now, according to the
          Ancient Astronaut theory, monumental building is something humans
          could not do and must have been introduced by aliens. Note there that
          Childress is also trying to connect these pyramids to burials.
        </p>
        <h2 id="pyramid">Peruvian Pyramids</h2>
        <p>
          Let's look at the history of Peruvian pyramids. I use the term pyramid
          a bit fast and loose here; what is referred to as pyramids in Peru is
          not comparable to a true pyramid as we see in Egypt. What we find here
          resembles maybe more the pyramids of Mesoamerica,&nbsp; but in many
          cases, I would perhaps refer to them as mounds or temples. I've also
          seen this in the books and articles that different authors use the
          terms pyramid and mound. However, they are often rectangular than
          square, consisting of platforms and staircases.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What is the earliest date for these types of monumental structures?
          The exciting thing is that this is something being explored and pushed
          back. We currently find Peru's first monumental constructions during
          the Late Archaic or Late Preceramic period at Bandurria in the Huacho
          region. The earliest radion carbon datings for the site are around
          3100-2800 calibrated BCE. The site has ten structures consisting of
          four main mounds between eight and twelve meters high. These mounds or
          pyramids were constructed using existing natural mounds, then adding
          layers of filling such as sand and gravel. The outer layer consists of
          rocks, not larger than that one person could easily carry two, that
          they put in place with a mortar of clay and saltgrass.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We should not forget the Caral-Supe society in the Norte Chico region.
          Much work in the area has been done by Ruth Shady Sol&iacute;s, who
          paved the way for later research in Norte Chico. Her co-authors on a
          2001 paper, Winifred Creamer and Jonathan Haas, have also done much
          work in the area. Even if Sol&iacute;s, Creamer, and Haas started as a
          team building on Ruth Sol&iacute;s work, the cooperation was
          short-lived and became a pretty famous feud. It may be worth
          revisiting at a later point. The earliest signs of buildings and
          communal projects start around 3100 BCE, around the time we see the
          temples in Bandurria. Pyramid-like structures, however, were not built
          until around 2500 BCE. From what I can tell, these platform mounds are
          made in a similar construction style to Bandurria. The largest city
          was in Caral, where at its height, estimations indicate that some 3000
          people lived there. One of the more famous platform pyramids
          incorporates an oval theater where flutes of condor and pelican bones
          were found. There are even examples of blue whale vertebrates being
          used as stools.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we have again a slow and steady evolution of constructions going
          back to 3000 BCE. The issue is that the cultures constructing these
          buildings did not practice headbinding or elongated skulls. That
          practice was only seen in the Paracas and Nazca cultures that we found
          1000 years after the end of Caral-Supe culture. While the Paracas
          culture did build platform mounds, I don't see any pyramid-like
          structures. In contrast to the Moche culture's adobe pyramids, the
          Nazca were not big on pyramids either. The exception is in Cahuachi,
          where we find pyramids, with the Great Temple as the city's crown.
          While the Great Temple is built in steps like a step pyramid, half the
          construction is supported by a mountain. I would instead classify it
          as a step-temple, but I see many references to it as a pyramid. This
          grand construction was built in several stages and had a ceremonial
          function, a civil function for nobility, a residential, and a funerary
          part. A tomb that seems to predate the construction was found at the
          top of the hill. Later burials have been found too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to stress, however, that the Nazca did not build the pyramids
          at Cahuachi as tombs. We know quite a bit about the Nazca burial
          patterns, and they primarily consist of funerary urns, pit burials,
          and nobility chamber tombs. The funerary urns seem to have been
          reserved for young individuals and children. The pit burials are the
          dominating burial form, and chamber tombs were constructed for what
          appears to be the nobility. There is an exception to these burial
          forms in La Mu&ntilde;a, where the Nazca people built mausoleums.
          There, we find pit burials but with a small construction on a bench,
          not unlike tombs we construct today in some parts of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this said, toward the end of the Nazca culture, when structures
          started to be abandoned, we began to see a resurgence of burials being
          constructed close to the Cahuachi pyramids. The question might be if
          it was due to the ceremonial function of the site or a tribute to the
          good old days.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, Childress's connection between Peruvian pyramids and burials is
          not as straightforward as he indicates. As we now know, the pyramid
          constructs predate the elongated skulls. But how about these skulls
          and the DNA test that Childress refers to?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="DNA">DNA of the elongated skulls of Nazca and Paracas</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not sure what test Childress refers to; from what I can tell,
          there has not been any testing at this point. Not even Brien Foerster
          made any claims regarding DNA in his 2015 book. If he had access to
          the test, I'm confident he would have promoted them in the book.
          Especially since he then claimed that he had obtained DNA tests that
          proved five Peruvian skulls were not human. Brien Foerster obtained
          the samples from the official-sounding Paracas History Museum. A small
          private museum created by Juan Navarro Hierro, who markets the place
          by letting Ancient Alien theorists play science with his collections
          of human remains.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As far I can tell, Brien Foerster has not published the DNA tests he
          performed. He has done some YouTube videos and Facebook posts on it
          and interviewed in Ancient Origins, but he has not done any
          publications. If he had the DNA evidence he claimed to have, I hardly
          believe any journal would refuse to publish it. The issue is the
          peer-review process, I guess, where any inaccuracies would show up.
          And just from the little Foerster has put out, I see a lot of red
          flags.
        </p>
        <p>
          How were the samples obtained? DNA samples are very sensitive, and
          contamination can happen quite easily. I get suspicious when I see on
          Paracas History Museum's Facebook page that Childress and Tsoukalos
          handle some of the remains without gloves. So, who knows how much
          contamination has been by people handling these remains? Especially
          since their origin seems a bit dubious. However, Dr. Jennifer Raff, an
          ancient DNA expert, found a video that appears to document parts of
          how Foerster obtained the sample. They needlessly disassemble a
          child's remains while taking samples without adequate protection.
          Several people are in the room; only two have gloves and a small mask
          to cover their mouths. But there are skin and hair exposed and would,
          of course, as Dr. Raff points out, contaminate these samples. Jennifer
          Raff points out in her article that to sample DNA properly, you must
          wear a suit that covers you from head to toe.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeologist Carl Faegans also found a now-deleted Facebook post that
          shows some of the results from Foerster's DNA tests. As Faegans points
          out, they only have one sample that's dated. There's also evidence of
          contamination, especially the U2e1, the H, and the R found among
          British and European people. Several of them were in attendance when
          taking the sample. Faegans continues to point out these flaws with the
          alleged results:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The "Baby Skull" sample of approximately 81 CE was probably
            contaminated with the DNA of Foerster or another person handling the
            remains.
          </li>
          <li>
            The bones and teeth of one or more specimens of unknown date or
            context reflect DNA consistent with someone indigenous to Peru (this
            person may be who the sample is from or even an unknown living
            contaminant).&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>
            The bone of another sample of unknown date or context shows DNA
            consistent with Europeans and someone indigenous to Peru. One or
            both may be the who the sample is from or one or more contaminants.
          </li>
          <li>
            The samples of two specimens of unknown date or context were too
            degraded (or damaged during collection) to test.
          </li>
          <li>One sample of unknown date or context was not tested.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>- Carl Faegans.</p>
        <p>
          Another clear indicator that Foerster's evidence is, at best,
          contaminated is the newly published test from Jessica Thorton et al.
          using Raman Spectroscopy and STR Analysis. They conclude that the
          elongated skulls they tested were human and that "Moreover, no foreign
          DNA or unusual profiles were observed in any of the Paracas samples
          tested."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have quite a good understanding of how the Paracas and Nazca
          cultures created the elongated skulls. We have examples of Peruvian
          cribs that utilized ropes, cushions, and boards, as described by Weiss
          in 1961. We have different cultures that achieved this with different
          variations of this method. As I mentioned in the past, elongated
          skulls were usual in Europe. In Toulouse, artificial cranial
          deformation was performed until the 20th century, so elongated skulls
          were often called the Toulouse deformity.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I think we can finally end the Alien discussion around artificial
          cranial deformation. It is at least clear that Childress, as we heard
          at the beginning of this section, was wrong on every single point he
          made. And on that, we will close this episode for this time. The Grey
          alien is a modern creation, and the historical claims made by the
          alien theorists have proven wrong at best.&nbsp;
