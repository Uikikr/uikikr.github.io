          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. The podcast where we examine
          strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in popular
          media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there
          better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 66, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. It’s summer, and I’m out traveling at the
          moment. This got me thinking about space travel of sorts. Within
          Ancient Aliens, we often hear these claims that the descriptions in
          the myths, stories, and accounts are people describing UFOs with the
          vocabulary they had access to. So when they speak of a giant flying
          fire-spitting dragon, they mean space rocket. As I have discussed
          throughout this show, this often just misrepresents what the authors
          really wanted to represent. In some cases, the text Ancient Aliens
          cites does not even contain the descriptions they claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this got me thinking. How would an ancient person attempt to
          describe space travel? Lucky for us, there’s one ancient author who
          did just this. In the second century CE, Lucian of Samosata wrote a
          short story titled “A true story.” Some claim that this is the first
          Sci-Fi novel in history. And it’s because it contains space travel,
          battles between alien beings, and intergalactic exchange. There are
          even descriptions of alien abductions. In reality, Lucian isn’t trying
          to make a Sci-Fi novel but a satirical criticism regarding travel
          books and the works of some historians. I think this novel might be of
          value to us because it’s someone from history providing us an insight
          into how they would picture space travel.
        </p>

          Just like athletes and wrestlers who work on their strength and
          agility, take care of their health, follow a regular exercise routine,
          and take breaks to stay in top shape, I believe scholars and students
          should do the same. After diving deep into serious studies, they
          should take a little break to refresh their minds. This way, they'll
          be better prepared for ongoing study sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          These breaks will be even more effective if spent on reading materials
          that aren't just enjoyable and provoke exciting thoughts. I think my
          books fit this purpose perfectly. They not only entertain with their
          unique subjects and engaging storytelling but also invite readers to
          think critically. In my writing, I use humor to poke fun at the old
          poets, historians, and philosophers who have recorded some pretty
          outrageous and untrue stories. I haven't named them directly, but
          you'll recognize them easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take Ctesias, for example. He wrote about India and its customs, but
          he had never seen those places or heard about them from anyone
          credible. Iambulus also penned many tall tales about the ocean, which
          everyone knew were made up but still found entertaining. Many others
          have followed suit, writing about their travels and describing bizarre
          animals and fierce humans with strange lifestyles. However, the
          original storyteller of this genre was Homer’s Ulysses. He spun
          incredible yarns for Alcinous about controlling the winds, one-eyed
          men who ate raw flesh, multi-headed beasts, and friends transformed by
          magic potions – and he convinced the gullible Phæakes it was all true.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing all this, I couldn’t fault ordinary people for lying when even
          so-called philosophers did it. But I was amazed that they didn’t
          expect to be caught despite writing such apparent lies. This inspired
          me to leave my mark too – I didn't want to be the only one not
          enjoying the liberty of lying. I created my own stories since I had no
          actual events worth writing about. But I’m more honest about it: I
          openly admit I lie. Hopefully, this confession will excuse the rest of
          my work as I write about things I haven’t seen, experienced, or heard
          from others – things that never existed and never will. So, don’t take
          any of it seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a favorable wind, I set sail from the Pillars of Hercules one
          day. I was driven by sheer curiosity, a desire for new experiences,
          and a longing to discover the ocean's boundaries and the people living
          on distant shores. I stocked up on food and water, gathered fifty
          like-minded companions, equipped ourselves with plenty of supplies,
          hired an experienced pilot, and readied a sturdy ship for the long and
          challenging journey ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sailed on with a favorable wind for a day and a night, taking it
          easy as long as we could see land. But the following day, just as the
          sun rose, the wind picked up, the waves grew wild, and a thick
          darkness fell over us. We couldn't even see well enough to lower the
          sails, so we let the ship ride the storm. For seventy-nine days, we
          were tossed about by this storm. On the eightieth day, the sun
          suddenly broke through, and we spotted an island not too far off. It
          was full of mountains and woods, and the sea around it was much
          calmer. We eagerly headed for it, went ashore, and collapsed on the
          ground, utterly exhausted from our ordeal at sea. After resting for a
          long time, we finally got up and divided into groups: thirty stayed to
          guard the ship, while I took twenty others to explore the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hadn't gone more than 600 meters through the woods when we came
          upon a bronze pillar with worn Greek letters inscribed saying,
          "Hercules and Bacchus traveled this far."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nearby, we found two large carvings in a rock: one about the size of
          an Olympic swimming pool and the other smaller. I guessed the smaller
          one was Bacchus, and the larger one was Hercules. After paying our
          respects, we continued our journey. Before long, we came to a river
          that seemed to flow with rich wine, like the best from Chios. It was
          wide enough in some places to carry a ship, which made me believe the
          inscription on the pillar even more, seeing these clear signs of
          Bacchus's travels. We decided to follow the river upstream to find its
          source. When we reached the head, we found no spring but countless
          enormous vine trees—from their roots flowed pure wine, creating the
          river. The stream was also full of fish that looked and tasted like
          wine. Those who ate them got drunk because they were full of wine
          dregs. We mixed some freshwater fish with them to tone down the strong
          taste of the wine.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then crossed the river, where it was shallow, and found ourselves
          in a forest of incredible vines. The vines had sturdy trunks, but from
          the hips up, they turned into women, like how Daphne is depicted when
          she transformed into a tree to escape Apollo. These vine-women had
          branches full of grapes sprouting from their fingers, and their hair
          was made of vine tendrils and grape clusters. When we approached, they
          greeted us, shook our hands, and spoke in Lydian, Indian, and mostly
          Greek. They also kissed us, but whoever got kissed would immediately
          get drunk and lose control for a while. They couldn’t stand having
          their grapes picked and would scream if anyone tried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of them wanted to be intimate with us, and two of our men
          accepted their offer. Afterward, they couldn’t break free and became
          rooted to the ground, with branches and tendrils sprouting from their
          fingers, ready to bear fruit. Seeing this, we fled to our ship and
          told the others what had happened, how our comrades were entangled
          with the vines. We filled containers with water and wine from the
          river and spent the night near the shore.
        </p>
        <p>
          We set sail again the next day, although the wind was relatively weak.
          A sudden whirlwind hit us around noon after we had lost sight of the
          island. It spun our ship around, lifted us about 600,000 meters into
          the air, and kept us there. We were carried aloft by a mighty wind
          that filled our sails. For seven days and nights, we were blown along
          in this manner. On the eighth day, we spotted a large, shiny island in
          the sky, glowing brightly. We approached and landed, finding the place
          inhabited and well-kept.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the day, we couldn’t see much, but at night, many other islands
          appeared, some larger and some smaller, all glowing like fire. Beneath
          us, we saw another land with cities, seas, rivers, woods, and
          mountains, which we figured was our own Earth. As we ventured further
          into the land, we were captured by the Hippogypians, who rode giant
          vultures instead of horses. These vultures had three heads each, and
          their feathers were bigger than the masts of tall ships. The
          Hippogypians' job was to patrol the land and bring any strangers to
          their king.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were taken to the king, who guessed we were Greeks based on our
          appearance. He asked how we had managed to travel through so much air.
          We told him our story, and he shared his own: he was once a man named
          Endymion who had been taken from Earth while sleeping and brought to
          this place, where Endymion somehow became king. He told us that this
          land was what we see as the moon from Earth. He assured us we had
          nothing to fear and would be well cared for. He also mentioned that if
          his ongoing war with the inhabitants of the sun went well, we would
          live in great happiness with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          We asked about his enemies and the cause of the war. He explained that
          Phaethon, king of the sun's inhabitants, had been waging war against
          them because Endymion had planned to send a colony to the Morning
          Star, a deserted land. Phaethon had thwarted this plan by sending his
          Hippomyrmicks, who intercepted them. Endymion now intended to renew
          the war and send the colony again. He invited us to join his
          expedition, promising us the best vultures and all necessary armor as
          they were setting out the next day. We agreed enthusiastically.
        </p>
        <p>
          That evening, we were feasted and stayed with him. As our scouts
          reported the enemy was near, we prepared for battle in the morning.
          Endymion's forces numbered one hundred thousand, plus carriers,
          engineers, foot soldiers, and additional allies. Eighty thousand were
          Hippogypians, and twenty thousand rode Lachanopters, giant birds with
          leaves instead of feathers. There were also Cenchrobolians,
          Scorodomachians, and reinforcements from the Bear Star: thirty
          thousand Psyllotoxotans, who rode giant fleas, and fifty thousand
          Anemodromians, who flew through the air using large mantles like
          sails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expected reinforcements from the stars over Cappadocia included
          seventy thousand Struthobalanians and five thousand Hippogeranians,
          but they hadn't arrived yet. Endymion's army was well-equipped with
          helmets made from large bean hulls and breastplates from lupin shells,
          making them as tough as horns. Their shields and swords resembled
          those from Greece. The Hippogypians formed the right wing, with the
          king and his best soldiers, including us. The Lachanopters took the
          left wing and arranged the rest in the center. The foot soldiers,
          about six thousand myriads, were led by Nycterion, son of Eudianax,
          and two others. Giant spiders spun a web between the Moon and the
          Morning Star, creating a field where the foot soldiers were
          positioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the enemy's side, the left wing was made up of the Hippomyrmicks,
          led by Phaethon. These creatures were enormous, winged, and looked
          like giant ants. The largest ones were about the size of football
          fields, and not only did the riders fight, but the ants also caused a
          lot of damage with their horns. There were fifty thousand of them. In
          the right wing were the Aeroconopes, also fifty thousand strong, all
          archers riding giant gnats. Next came the Aerocardakes, lightly armed
          foot soldiers who were good in battle, throwing giant turnips from
          slings. Anyone hit by these turnips would soon die from the horrible
          smell, as they were coated with a toxic mallow substance. Following
          them were fifty thousand Caulomycetes, heavily armed soldiers with
          mushroom shields and asparagus stalk spears. Nearby were the
          Cynobalanians, sent from the Dog Star, men with dog faces riding on
          winged acorns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slingers from the Milky Way and the Nephelocentaurs arrived too
          late to help as the battle was over. In fact, the slingers never
          showed up at all, which angered Phaethon so much that he overran their
          country.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the forces Phaethon brought to the battle. When the signal
          was given, and the asses (not that ass, a donkey, of course) on either
          side brayed (they used these instead of trumpets), the fight began.
          The left wing of the Sun soldiers quickly fled from the Hippogypians,
          leading to a significant slaughter. However, the right wing of the Sun
          soldiers pushed back our left wing until they reached our foot
          soldiers. Our foot soldiers joined forces and made the enemies turn
          and flee, especially after realizing their left wing was defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the enemy was entirely routed, with many captured and slain.
          Blood was spilled everywhere, some falling on the clouds, making them
          appear red like during a sunset, and some dropping to Earth. I think
          Homer might have gotten his idea of Jupiter raining blood from
          something similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the pursuit, we set up two monuments for our glory and victory:
          one for the ground battle on the spiders' web and another for the
          aerial fight on the clouds. Just as we finished, our scouts reported
          that the Nephelocentaurs were approaching. They should have joined
          Phaethon before the battle. When they came into view, they were a
          sight to behold—monsters with the bodies of flying horses and the
          upper halves of men as big as the Rhodian Colossus and large ships.
          The Sagittarius led them from the Zodiac. Upon learning of their
          allies' defeat, they sent a messenger to Phaethon to restart the
          fight. They quickly arranged themselves and attacked the Moon
          soldiers, who were scattered while gathering spoils. The Moon soldiers
          were routed, the king was chased into his city, most of his birds were
          killed, the trophies were overturned, and the spiders' spun territory
          was conquered. My two companions and I were captured alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Phaethon arrived, they set up their monuments instead to
          celebrate their victory. The following day, we were taken to the Sun
          with our arms bound behind us with a piece of the cobweb. They didn’t
          lay siege to the city but built a double wall of clouds in the sky to
          block the sunlight from reaching the Moon, causing a total eclipse and
          perpetual night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep troubled by the darkness, Endymion sent ambassadors to plead for
          the wall to be torn down, promising to pay tribute, be a friend, and
          never again rise against Phaethon. Phaethon's council met twice; at
          first, they refused, but the next day, they reconsidered and agreed to
          these terms:
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Sun people (Heliotans) and their allies have made peace with the
          Moon people (Selenitans) and their allies under these terms: The Sun
          people will take down the wall and release the prisoners for a fair
          ransom. The Moon people will leave the other stars alone and not start
          any wars with the Sun people. Instead, they will help each other if
          either is attacked. The Moon king will pay the Sun king a yearly
          tribute of ten thousand vessels of dew and provide ten thousand of
          their people as hostages to ensure their loyalty. Both groups will
          jointly send a colony to the Morning Star, allowing anyone else to
          join if they want. These peace terms will be engraved on an amber
          pillar, to be erected in the sky at the border of their lands. The Sun
          people representatives, Pyronides, Therites, and Phlogius, and the
          Moon people representatives, Nyctor, Menius, and Polylampes, have
          sworn to uphold these terms."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, peace was concluded, the wall was demolished, and we
          prisoners were freed. When we returned to the Moon, Endymion, and his
          friends welcomed us with open arms and tears of joy. He asked us to
          stay and join the colony, even offering me his son in marriage (since
          no women were there). I politely declined, wanting to return to the
          sea. After seven days of feasting, he reluctantly allowed us to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let me share some bizarre things I observed during my stay.
          First, they are not born of women but of men. They have no concept of
          women. Until they turn twenty-five, they are given in marriage to
          others, and after that, they take others in marriage themselves, not
          unlike the practice of Pederasty in Athens. When a baby is conceived,
          the man's leg swells. When it's time for birth, they make an incision
          and take the baby out, which is initially dead. They open the baby's
          mouth towards the wind, and it comes to life. This might be why Greeks
          call it the 'belly of the leg,' as it serves the same purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even stranger, there are men called Dendritans who are born in a
          rather macabre way. They cut out the right testicle from a man and
          plant it in the ground. From this grows a tree of flesh with branches
          and leaves, bearing fruit that looks like a cubit-long acorn. When
          ripe, they harvest these fruits and cut out men from them. Their
          private parts can be attached and removed as needed. Rich men have
          ones made of ivory, while poor men use wooden ones. These are used for
          procreation and intimate relations.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a man reaches his full age, he doesn't die in the usual sense;
          instead, he dissolves into smoke and turns into air. Their food is
          unique: they light a fire and broil frogs, which are plentiful and fly
          through the air. As the frogs cook, they gather around the fire and
          inhale the smoke, which is their meal. For drink, they beat the air in
          a mortar until it becomes moist, like dew. They don't have to worry
          about excreting waste since they produce none.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their boys engage in a form of intimacy that's different from ours,
          using a small opening behind their legs. Being bald is considered very
          attractive, and hairy people are looked down upon, except among the
          comet stars, where hair is admired. They grow beards above their knees
          and have no toenails; their feet are just one big toe. Each person has
          a long, unbreakable cabbage-like tail growing from their backside. The
          mucus from their noses is sweeter than honey.
        </p>
        <p>
          When they work or exercise, they rub their bodies with milk. If some
          of their sweet mucus mixes with the milk, it becomes cheese. They
          produce a fragrant, high-quality oil from beans. They have many vines
          that produce water instead of wine, and the grape clusters resemble
          hailstones. I believe that when a strong wind shakes these vines, it
          causes hailstorms on Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their bellies act as pouches to store their belongings, which they can
          open and close at will. They don't have livers or entrails; their
          insides are rough and hairy, allowing them to keep their young warm
          inside their bellies. Rich people wear soft, delicate garments made of
          glass, while the poor wear clothes woven from brass, which they soften
          with water, much like we do with wool.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their eyes are remarkable: they can take them in and out as they
          please. If someone wants to rest their eyes, they can simply remove
          them and set them aside until needed again. Those who lose their eyes
          can borrow from others, as the rich often have extra pairs lying
          around. Their ears are made from the leaves of plane trees, except
          those born from acorns, which have wooden ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw another strange thing in that same court: a colossal glass lying
          over a shallow pit. Anyone who descends into the pit can hear
          everything happening on Earth. And if they look into the glass, they
          can see all the cities and nations as clearly as they were there. I
          saw all my friends and the whole country around me. Whether they saw
          me or not, I can't say. If you don't believe it, go there yourself,
          and you'll see I'm telling the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We set sail again after saying our goodbyes to the king and his
          courtiers. Endymion gave me two glass mantles, five brass ones, and a
          complete set of armor made from lupin shells, all of which I left
          behind in the whale. He also sent a thousand Hippogypians to escort us
          for 11,000 kilometers. We passed many other lands along the way and
          finally arrived at the Morning Star, now newly inhabited. We landed,
          got fresh water, and continued our journey through the Zodiac, passing
          by the Sun. Although our crew wanted to land in the Sun's country, the
          wind didn't allow it. We saw it was a lush, well-watered land full of
          delights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nephelocentaurs, who were mercenaries for Phaethon, spotted us.
          Realizing we were friendly, they left us alone since our Hippogypian
          escorts had departed. We sailed through the night and day, and by
          evening, we arrived at a city called Lychnopolis, located in the air
          between the Pleiades and the Hyades, just below the Zodiac. We saw no
          people in this city, only countless lights moving around. Some were in
          the marketplace, some at the harbor. There were small, humble, and
          large, magnificent lights, each with its own place and name. We heard
          them speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lights didn't harm us but invited us to feast with them. However,
          we were too scared to eat or sleep while we were there. The court of
          justice stood in the city center, where the governor sat all night,
          calling each light by name. Those who didn't respond were sentenced to
          "death," which meant being extinguished. We witnessed these
          proceedings, heard the lights explain their lateness, and even spoke
          to our own light, learning about affairs back home.
        </p>
        <p>
          We spent the night there and returned to our ship the following day.
          As we sailed near the clouds, we caught sight of the city
          Nephelococcygia, which amazed us, but we didn't enter because of the
          wind. Its king was Coronus, son of Cottyphion. I couldn't help but
          think of the poet Aristophanes, realizing how wise and truthful he was
          and how little reason there is to doubt his writings.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the third day after our departure, we finally saw the ocean again,
          though we could only see the floating lands in the air, which looked
          fiery and glittering. By noon on the fourth day, the wind gently
          calmed and settled us slowly back into the sea. As soon as we realized
          we were on the water again, we were overjoyed and couldn't contain our
          happiness. We celebrated with the provisions we had, swam around for
          fun since the sea was calm, and made merry.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a turn for the better can often lead to greater troubles.
          After just two days of smooth sailing, on the third day at sunrise, we
          encountered many monstrous fishes and whales. One whale, in
          particular, was enormous—about 330,000 meters in size. It approached
          us with its mouth wide open, stirring the sea into a frothy mess. Its
          teeth, longer than any beech tree and as sharp as needles, gleamed
          white like ivory. Thinking this was the end, we embraced and said what
          we thought was our final goodbyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The monster reached us quickly and swallowed our ship whole, but
          luckily, it didn't crush us. Instead, our ship slipped through its
          gaping mouth and slid into its stomach. We were in complete darkness
          until the whale opened its mouth again. Then we saw that we were
          inside a monstrous whale, big enough to contain a city of ten thousand
          people. There were bits of fish, ship masts, anchors, human bones, and
          luggage scattered around. In the middle was a land with hills, likely
          formed from the mud settling inside the whale. Woods, trees of all
          kinds, and various herbs grew there, making it look like a farmed
          landscape. The land was about 5,200 kilometers in circumference, and
          there were all sorts of sea birds nesting in the trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, we wept abundantly, but eventually, I rallied my crew. We
          propped up our ship, struck a fire, and prepared supper with the
          abundance of fish around us. Fortunately, we still had enough water
          from the Morning Star to sustain us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following day, we woke early to watch for the whale's gaping
          mouth. Through it, we could sometimes see mountains, sometimes just
          the sky, and often islands. The whale moved swiftly through the sea.
          Tired of this, I took seven of my crew and ventured into the woods to
          see what we could find. After about a kilometer, we found a temple
          dedicated to Neptune and several sepulchers with pillars and a clear
          water fountain. We also heard a dog barking and saw smoke in the
          distance, indicating habitation nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hurrying along, we found an older man and a young boy tending a garden
          and channeling water from the fountain. Both they and we were struck
          with joy and fear, and we all stood mute for a while. The old man
          finally spoke, asking, "Who are you? Spirits of the sea or miserable
          men like us? We were born and bred on Earth but now live within this
          whale, unsure of our existence. We feel like dead men who believe they
          are alive."
        </p>
        <p>
          I replied, "Father, we are men too. We were swallowed up with our ship
          just yesterday and came into these woods hoping to find something
          good. Some kind angel must have guided us to you, showing us we are
          not alone in this monster. Please, tell us your story."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man said, "You shall hear nothing from me until you've shared
          our food." He then took us to his humble home, where he served us
          herbs, nuts, fish, and wine. After we were satisfied, he asked about
          our adventures. I told him everything: the storm, the island, our
          flight through the air, the war, and our dive into the whale. He was
          amazed and began to share his tale.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am from the isle of Cyprus," he said. "I was a merchant traveling
          with my son and many friends, on a voyage to Italy in a large ship
          filled with merchandise. You may have seen the wreckage in the whale's
          mouth. We sailed well until we reached Sicily, where a terrible storm
          drove us into the ocean. There, we encountered this whale, which
          swallowed us all. Only my son and I survived; the rest perished. We
          buried them and built a temple to Neptune. Since then, we've lived
          here, planting herbs, eating fish and nuts, using the abundant wood,
          and enjoying the delicate wine from the vines. We have a well of cool
          water and make beds from tree leaves. We catch birds and fish on the
          whale's gills. There's even a saltwater lake nearby, about 400
          kilometers in circumference, where we swim and sail in a boat I made.
          This is our twenty-seventh year here. We might be content if not for
          our troublesome neighbors."
        </p>
        <p>"Are there others here besides you?" I asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes," he replied. "Many, and they are unfriendly and monstrous. The
          western part, near the whale's tail, is inhabited by the Tarychanians,
          who look like eels with lobster faces. They are warlike and eat raw
          flesh. To the right are the Tritonomendetans, with human upper bodies
          and cat lower bodies, who are less hostile. The left side is home to
          the Carcinochirians and the Thinnocephalians, who are allied. The
          middle region belongs to the Paguridians and the Psettopodians, who
          are swift and warlike. The eastern part, near the whale's mouth, is
          mostly deserted and overwashed by the sea. I live there, paying an
          annual tribute of five hundred oysters to the Psettopodians."
        </p>
        <p>
          Many nations inhabit this land. We needed to decide whether to fight
          them or find a way to live among them. I asked, "How many are there?"
        </p>
        <p>"More than a thousand," he replied.</p>
        <p>"And what kind of weapons do they have?" I asked.</p>
        <p>"None, just fish bones," he said.</p>
        <p>
          "Then it's best to fight them," I suggested, "since we're better
          armed. If we defeat them, we can live without fear." We all agreed and
          went back to our ship to gather our weapons. The reason for the war
          started when we didn't pay the tribute due. They sent messengers to
          demand it, but Scintharus, the older man, gave them a harsh and
          scornful reply and sent them away empty-handed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scintharus's response angered the Psettopodians and Paguridians, who
          came against us with great noise. Expecting this, we prepared
          ourselves. We placed twenty-five of our men in ambush, instructing
          them to attack once the enemy had passed. They did so, springing from
          their hiding places and attacking the enemy from the rear. We, another
          twenty-five, including Scintharus and his son, advanced to meet them
          head-on with great courage and strength. Ultimately, we defeated them
          and chased them back to their dens.
        </p>
        <p>
          We killed one hundred and seventy of the enemy, losing only one of our
          own besides Trigles, our pilot, who was pierced through the back with
          a fish rib. That day and the following night, we stayed in our
          trenches and set up a dry dolphin backbone as a victory trophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following day, the rest of the inhabitants realized what had
          happened and came to attack us. The Tarychanians, led by Pelamus, took
          the right wing. The Thinnocephalians were on the left, and the
          Carcinochirians formed the main battle line. The Tritonomendetans,
          however, stayed out of it and didn't join either side. We met them
          near Neptune's temple and engaged in battle with a loud cry that
          echoed through the whale-like cave. But since they were unarmed and
          naked, we quickly defeated them and chased them into the woods, taking
          control of the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, they sent ambassadors to ask for the bodies of their dead
          and to negotiate peace. We had no intention of making peace, so the
          next day, we attacked and killed all of them except the
          Tritonomendetans, who fled through the whale's gills into the sea. We
          then explored the now-deserted country, living there without fear of
          enemies. We spent our time exercising, hunting, planting vineyards,
          and enjoying the fruits of the trees, living like men who had the
          world at their disposal, albeit in a vast, inescapable prison.
        </p>
        <p>
          We lived this way for a year and eight months. On the fifth day of the
          ninth month, when the whale opened its mouth for the second time that
          hour (we guessed the time based on this), we suddenly heard a loud cry
          and a mighty noise like sailors shouting and oars moving, which
          startled us. We crept up to the whale's mouth and, standing within its
          teeth, saw the strangest sight: enormous men, 100 meters tall, sailing
          on huge islands as if they were ships.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this sounds unbelievable, but here it is. The islands were long
          but not very high, about 2000 kilometers in circumference. Each island
          carried twenty-eight of these giant men, who sat on either side rowing
          with entire cypress trees, branches, and all, as oars. At the back,
          the captain stood on a high hill with a brazen rudder 200 meters long.
          At the front, forty soldiers, looking like men except for their
          flaming hair, stood ready for battle. They didn't need helmets as
          their hair burned brightly. The island's trees acted as sails,
          catching the wind and moving the island like a ship, directed by
          pilots.

          At first, we saw only two or three of these islands, but soon, there
          were no less than six hundred. They divided into two groups and
          prepared to battle. Many collided and broke apart; some capsized and
          drowned. The soldiers fought fiercely, showing great bravery, with no
          prisoners taken. Instead of iron grapples, they used giant polypodes,
          which they threw to latch onto the other islands, securing them in
          place. They hurled enormous oysters and sponges the size of three
          tennis courts at each other as weapons.

          The leaders were Æolocentaurus on one side and Thalassopotes on the
          other. Their quarrel was over a stolen booty; Thalassopotes had
          allegedly driven away many flocks of dolphins belonging to
          Æolocentaurus, as we gathered from their shouts and calls to their
          kings. Æolocentaurus won the day, sinking 150 of the enemy's islands
          and capturing three with all their men. The rest fled but were not
          pursued far, as it was getting late. The victors salvaged what they
          could from the wrecks and took their dead away. They lost eighty
          islands in the battle.

          The victors erected a monument to their victory by fastening one of
          the enemy islands on a stake on the whale's head. They anchored near
          the whale that night with massive, strong glass anchors. The following
          day, after sacrificing on the whale and burying their dead, they
          sailed away triumphantly, singing songs of victory. And that was the
          remarkable battle of the islands.
