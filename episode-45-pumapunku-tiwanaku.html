          This time, we will explore the fantastic ruins of Puma Punku (or
          Pumapunku), a temple complex located within Tiwanaku (Tiahuanaco or
          Tiahuanacu). This site lies in modern Bolivia, and its stunning stone
          masonry has given rise to speculation about alien visitation. Let's
          investigate the site, what we know, and what has been done in the
          past. We will see that the alien theories are rather lazy compared to
          the site's real history and archaeology.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 45, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we're having a special episode
          dealing with only the site of Puma Punku (or Pumapunku), a complex
          located in Tiwanaku (Tiahuanaco or Tiahuanacu) in modern Bolivia. The
          site is known for its marvelous stones, some shaped like giant letter
          H. Of course, the Alien proponents claim aliens built this as a
          landing zone or something else. We will look into these claims and
          figure out what's really going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick little promotion here. I'll speak at Skepticamp on the 22nd of
          September in Manchester, UK. It's part of the QED event this weekend.
          If you attend, make sure to say hi.

          five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="pumapunku">The History of Tiwanaku and Puma Punku</h2>
        <p>
          We are back around Lake Titicaca again. How about we start with the
          Ancient Alien description of the site?
        </p>
        <p>
          "These are the mysterious ruins of Puma Punku, nearly 13,000 feet in
          the altiplano of Bolivia. What you have here are massive blocks of
          granite scattered like some kid's toy blocks around the site. It's
          like some giant cataclysm just wiped out this entire area.
          Archaeologists are baffled by what Puma Punku was, how it looked, and
          what the purpose of this enormous structure would have been." - David
          Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with what Puma Punku is because there seems to be some
          confusion about this among the Ancient Alien theorists. Puma Punku
          could maybe be better described as a temple complex. The site is
          centered around a platform mound with a sunken plaza and monumental
          buildings on top. Around the mound, we find ramps and plazas that seem
          to belong to this temple complex. Puma Punku is, however, not the only
          construction in the area. It would be similar to claiming Notre Dame
          to be an individual site. There are, of course, infrastructure and
          other buildings around the complex. Puma Punku is just one location at
          Tiwanaku, a place or, maybe more accurately, a city that, at its peak
          around 800 CE, inhabited up to 20,000 people.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the episode, we will show how unbaffled archaeologists are
          about the site. The pedant in me also wants to clarify something right
          now. The stone structures are not built from granite. I don't
          understand the Ancient Astronauts' fetish around granite. I mean, you
          do you, we don't kinkshame here, but come on. To give Childress some
          way out, Jakob Tschudi did write in the 1860s that Tiwanaku got their
          granite slabs from Cerro Ckapia. As we will learn, the stone used on
          the site is called andesite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The always exciting question is, of course, how old is Pumapunku and
          Tiwanaku? Hugh Newman, author of Earth Grids that, we covered in
          "Aliens and the Secret Code," claims the age to be as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Arthur Posnansky was a researcher who was part Bolivian, and he
          worked at the site for many decades, and he concluded that the site
          must have been built about 17,000 years ago by studying the
          archaeoastronomical of that particular site." - Hugh Newman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Arthur or Arthuro Posnansky is quite an exciting fellow. He is
          problematic but still an interesting person. The last name Posnansky
          is not a Bolivian family name, and if you go online, you will note
          that Arthur is claimed to be of Polish, Austrian, German, and Bolivian
          descent. So how is it then? If we look at the name, it seems that
          Arthurs's family, to some extent, stems from a Russian Jewish family
          relocated to Poland. The name originates in Pozn&aacute;n, a region in
          central modern Poland. The area was inhabited by many Germans and
          Russians during the 1860s. Both would spell the name differently
          compared to the Polish people. In Polish, the proper way to construct
          the name would be Posnanski. Germans spelled it Posen, and Russians
          would spell it Posnansky. In 1861, the "Emancipation of the Serfs"
          took place, letting people move more freely. Many well of people took
          this opportunity to leave the area. During this period,
          Austria-Hungary was one of the few places where Jews could get full
          citizenship, so many moved to Vienna, where Arthur was born in 1877.
          But we should note that Arthur grew up and lived in Germany, where his
          family owned several factories, spoke German, and got his education in
          Germany. He always preferred German and Austrian scholars, ideas, and
          equipment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          However, he spent most of his life in Bolivia, where he got
          citizenship as Arturo Posnansky. So Arthur was not part Bolivian but
          later adopted the citizenship while not necessarily the Bolivian
          culture. In fact, he referred to the indigenous people as animalistic
          half-breeds. Posnansky's racism grew as time passed and culminated in
          his work "What is Race," where he divided different people into
          superior and inferior. Germany ranked high with Japan, while Russia
          and China were bad. Based on his Jewish heritage, it's not strange
          that Arthur strongly criticized Germany's political appropriation of
          race and argued that Jews or Aryans were not races. He also defended
          the Jewish community.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While Posnansky was educated, he had no archaeology, anthropology, or
          history background. His experience seems to have been that of a naval
          engineer and businessman. Something that becomes clear in his work.
          While Posnansky did a lot of important work at Tiwanaku, it was mainly
          by documenting the structures, art, and gateways. However, his
          theories around the site are based solely on Arthurs's crankish idea
          that Tiwanaku was first located by the coast. But later, a tectonic
          movement pushed the area to become the Altiplano plains.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Posnansky most often claimed that the Tiwanaku site was 12,000 years
          old, but to Newman's credit, there are some mentions of 17,000 BCE.
          How was this date determined? Well, since this was way before the
          invention of C14, Posnansky relied on astronomy. Arthur received
          funding from Germany to set up an observatory in Bolivia in 1926 and
          then went out and made up alignments. Archeoastronomy has its place
          within our field, but Posnansky's method gives room for
          improvement.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I mentioned that Posnansky was problematic, and I think you start to
          see this too, but let's dig some more, shall we? We get a connection
          to Thor Heyerdahl here, the Norwegian explorer most famous, maybe for
          his voyage with Kon-Tiki. Heyerdahl made the voyage to prove his idea
          of a white superior race emigrating from South America, possibly
          Tiwanaku, to Easter Island. They made this journey since, according to
          Heyerdahl, an inferior race forced them out. I find it likely that
          parts of this idea stem from Posnansky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Posnansky described Tiwanaku's history with two separate races, one
          inferior and one superior. These races were based on craniometry,
          eugenics, and the physical anthropology ideas of the time. The theory
          culminated in the 1937 work "Anthropology and Sociology of
          Inter-Andean and Neighboring Races," where he expanded on the
          scientific racism that resulted in the book "What is Race," published
          in 1943. The ideas received criticism already then, maybe most notably
          by Juan Comas. While Heyerdahl doesn't cite these two later works in
          his 1952 book "American Indians in the Pacific," it would be strange
          if these ideas did not influence him. Heyerdahl did rely on much of
          Posnansky's other work, and their ideas are very similar.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But if Posnansky's date is not accurate now, what is the truth then?
          It is often more complicated than what shows like this portray it. Let
          us start at the beginning. When do we begin to see the first
          settlements around Lake Titicaca? While people have lived in the area
          for a long time, it's important to note that the shift from mobile
          groups to sedentary areas was not based on agriculture. This shift
          seems to have taken place around 2000 BCE, where we also see the
          introduction of new technologies such as simple architecture,
          ceramics, and a slow start of the domestication of plants. This period
          is usually referred to as Late Archaic. As I mentioned, the growth of
          small villages was not due to the introduction of agriculture; the
          population predominantly relied on fish and foraging. What is
          interesting here is that ceramic seems to not have been a transformal
          event as it was in Europe. It appears to be viewed as another
          technology to add to the toolbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 2000 BCE, we enter into the Early Formative period. Here, we
          start to see settlements grow with agriculture and the domestication
          of animals as a primary fuel. We see gardens and fields being used,
          and the people around Titicaca herded camelids and guinea pigs. We
          also start to see trade and social ranks begin in this era.
        </p>
        <p>
          The evolution of a ranked society continued during the Middle
          Formative Period, which lasted roughly 1300 to 500 BCE. Again, we see
          evidence of increased agriculture and probably the area's first use of
          raised-field agriculture. One of the most known pre-Tiwanaku sites is
          Chiripa, where we truly see a ranked government take form. The site is
          dominated by a large mound with a 22-meter-long sunken plaza. In the
          middle of this court, we find a carved stone. The residential houses
          contain beautiful decorations such as painted walls, carved niches,
          and yellow brick floors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the later part of this Middle Formative Period, we find the
          earliest construction of Tiwanaku. Currently, the often-accepted date
          of the Tiwanaku site is around 800 BCE. However, there is one
          carbon-14 sample that puts the date much further back in the 1600 BCE.
          However, from the looks of things, this sample taken in 1970 by Carlos
          Ponce Sangriens might have been contaminated. Then we have Eric Marsh,
          who suggests we need to move the start date for Tiwanaku into the
          first century CE. Much of the analyzed material doesn't predate the
          Late formative period and, therefore, opens up the question of when
          Tiwanaku was founded. One example Marsh points out is the lack of
          Middle Formative Pottery in Tiwanaku. But as we see here, it did not
          appear out of nothing and has a long line of social and technological
          evolution behind it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the site of Tiwanaku could have been founded at the earliest
          around 800 BCE, but how is it with the date for Puma Punku? A cabron
          14 date from the site's earliest stage gave a calibrated date of
          536-600 CE. So well after the date Ancient Aliens suggest. This date
          is quite reasonable concerning the other monumental sites at Tiwanaku.
          While Pumapunku is the most known location, we have at least three
          more places. The Kherikala, also known as the subterranean temple, the
          Kalasasaya, and what's often referred to as the twin of Pumapunku, the
          Akapana. The Kherikala and the Kalasasaya are among the Ancient Alien
          proponents described as part of Puma Punku. But to reuse our Paris
          example from before, it would be as saying the Arc de Triomphe and the
          Eifel Tower are part of Notre Dame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, The Akapana is in worse shape than the Puma Punku and
          is not getting the same attention as its companion. If it had not been
          for excavations taking place in recent years, most visitors would not
          be able to distinguish it from a natural hillside. While the layout of
          Puma Punku and the Akapana are slightly different, they have the same
          design. Both are platform structures that lead the ritual attendees up
          through stairs and even with their massive size, they create intimate
          spaces where the rituals can take form. We also see that while
          Akapana, in its prime, probably had more visual dominance due to its
          height and size, Pumapunku seemed to have focused more on ritual
          dominance with its massive stone gates and blind portals. I also think
          it's important to stress that the monuments were clearly part of a
          larger plan.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Something often left out among the pseudo archeologists is that Puma
          Punku was never completed. Tiwanaku went into decline and was
          abandoned before this massive complex was entirely constructed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="tools">Construction of Puma Punku</h2>
        <p>
          So now we know more about the site, its history, and some of the
          previous work done here. All great stuff, but the Alien theorists
          have&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "One of the amazing things here at Puma Punku is the precision of the
          blocks. You can see with this block of granite that it's really been
          cut at very accurate right angles. Not only do these granite blocks
          have precision corners, but they also have these difficult drill holes
          that are going right through the rock." - David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this clip, we see Childress walking around with a set square and
          accidentally showing that the blocks aren't at the right angles. They
          did not have to put this in the episode. They could have filmed it
          from a different angle. But they didn't, and I'm thankful for this.
          Again, this is not granite; it's andesite and red sandstone. But they
          ask a valid question: how were the stones cut and dressed?
        </p>
        <p>
          Giorgio Tsoukalos and Christoffer Dunn offer a logical fallacy and a
          horrific experiment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Christopher Dunn: "You've got vitrification on the laser-cut side, and
          then, of course, you've got circular tool marks on the side cut with
          the diamond saw. And then, whatever tool they used to cut the ancient
          surface must have been a different&nbsp; method."
        </p>
        <p>
          Giorgio Tsoukalos: "Now, do you think it's possible that some type of
          a diamond precision tool was used on the old surface, but because it
          was such a long time ago, that over time, the surface became a bit
          more rough, and we're talking ten or even 15,000 years ago?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Christopher Dunn: "That is a reasonable speculation. I think we have
          to start examining a little more sophisticated tools that no longer
          exist."
        </p>
        <p>
          So these two got ahold of a stone from Pumapunku and then proceeded to
          saw and laser-cut it. Where and how they obtained this artifact and
          the ethical discussion before destroying it is unknown. But note that
          they somehow ruled out any other method than the diamond-tipped tool
          even when it did not match. They didn't test anything else, giving us
          a bit of a false dilemma. I also want to state that looking at the
          cuts, it's clear that the diamond saw is exceptionally different from
          the original side. As we learned previously, the site is only 1500
          years old, not nearly enough time to get the weathering Tsoukalos
          suggests.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, let's leave the diamond-tipped precision tools. Could there have
          been something else used? Are there any tools found? Unfortunately, we
          have not found any artifacts classified as chisels. The people of
          Twianaku did have metalwork to some extent. We have found these
          I-shaped cramps to hold the stones together. At Puma Punku, they seem
          to have cast the cramps in place. But over at Akapana, they used
          copper-nickel-arsenic alloys that were cold hammered into shape. So,
          they clearly had and used metals. So why don't we find metal chisels
          at Tiwanaku?
        </p>
        <p>
          One answer could be that they didn't use chisels of metal. We have
          previously talked about experimental archaeologist Denys Stocks. While
          mainly dealing with Egyptian archaeology, Stock's ideas can, of
          course, be implemented here. Stocks did experiments to determine how
          the Egyptians got those excellent cuts. On granite, diorite, and even
          hard limestone, copper, and bronze tools are quickly damaged. Even
          modern steel required frequent and severe sharpening. Stocks then
          started experimenting with flint chisels, and with these tools, he got
          results much closer to the Egyptian work.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, hammerstones seem to have been used for the stone-cutting process.
          This is based on the pit scars and patterns of throughs, cups, and
          pans that we find on stones still raw at the quarry and on stones
          dragged to the site ready to be quartered in smaller blocks.
          Jean-Pierre Protzen, who has done tremendous work on Andean stone
          work, described this back in 1993. One hammerstone of hematite with
          scars of use has been found out of context, unfortunately, but it
          still gives us an idea of what they could have used. There are also
          scattered across Tiwanaku quartzite cobbles that could make great
          hammer stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stella Nair and Protzen tried to find out what method could have been
          used for the H-blocks and the other intricate carvings. Armed with
          previous research and Stock experiments, they tried to find suitable
          material. The Tiwanaco used the finest Andesite stone for their most
          exquisite work; Andesite usually is around 5.5 to 6 on the Moh scale.
          This measures the hardness of a rock. The team says that ideally, they
          would have used Tiwanaco stones, but for apparent reasons, they
          selected a suitable substitute, a rhyolite stone. As for chisels,
          there were a couple of options, so they added, according to Nair,
          "flint, agate, and jasper, obsidian, greywacke, quartzite, and
          hematite."
        </p>
        <p>
          To get a smooth surface, Protzen used a quote, "repeated and
          systematic use of the straight edge, such that he repeatedly moved the
          straight edge in concentric circles around several fixed points, he
          could obtain a flat, planar surface while hammering." While it's
          possible that the Tiwanku builders used a straight edge, they could
          have used another tool too. In Egypt, for example, they used a tool
          called Boning Rod, three rods on a string to get a surface flat. The
          Greeks, in turn, used something called "surface plates" to get that
          extremely close fit on the column drums.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Nair realized during the experimentation that depending on whether the
          form cut was exterior or interior, two-plane or three-plane different
          stones were more suitable. But with, quote: "jasper, and then finer
          flint and obsidian blades Nair was able to work within half a
          millimeter of the final line." The nice incisions in the internal
          edges were done with microblades of obsidian and flint. To get the
          delicate, smooth look of Tiwanaco masonry, some polishing and cleanup
          were needed. After the work, tool marks were visible; these were
          removed by polishing the stone with obsidian.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the question had more options than we were first presented with.
          While the tools used have not been found, this experiment gives us a
          remarkable insight into how the builders could have done it. It also
          proves that humans can be creative when thinking outside the box. I
          believe this also shows the Ancient Alien proponent's lack of
          imagination. Since we use power tools today, they must have used them
          in the past.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But could there be something else? Something proving that the Tiwanaco
          had contact with aliens or at least with Sumer?
        </p>
        <h2 id="fuentemagna">Fuente Magna Bowl</h2>
        <p>
          So, could there be evidence of contact between Sumer and Tiwanaco? I
          doubt it, but let's look at the Ancient Alien claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is perhaps one of the most important archaeological artifacts
          ever discovered in Tiahuanaco or Puma Punku. This is the famous Fuente
          Magna Bowl discovered near Tiahuanaco. It's a ceramic bowl, and it has
          written on it Sumerian cuneiform, plus Proto-Sumerian hieroglyphic
          script. This script is coming from circa 3,000 BC. It draws a direct
          connection between the ancient Sumerians and Tiahuanaco and Puma
          Punku." - David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the first issue here is that, as Childress states, Sumer was a
          thing around 3000 BCE. We know that Tiwanaco did not exist until the
          earliest 800 BCE. And as we discovered just a few moments ago, the
          date is more likely around 100 CE. So there's a bit of a distance
          between these two cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second issue is that the artifact was not found by an
          archaeologist, and, to be honest, we don't really know where or when
          it was found. In most cases, it's often reported that it was
          discovered in 1950. But you will also encounter dates such as 1958,
          1960, and others. The discoverer is supposed to be a local farmer at
          the capitalized CHUA hacienda. As this would be some sort of acronym,
          it's not, and this farm is thought to have been owned by a Manjon
          family. There is a Chu&aacute; Hacienda, however, north of Lake
          Titicaca. Kieth Fitz-Patrick points out that two psuedoscience
          believers set out to find either the Manjon family or the owner. By
          showing pictures of the bowl, they encountered a man who recognized
          it. Only known as Maximillian, he called the bowl "el plato del
          chancho" since he had used it as a feeding tray for pigs before giving
          it to the museum.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that the bowl ended up in a publication in 1975 in Hoy,
          Suplemento, L.P. 6 - VII, written by Max Portugal Zamora (La Fuente
          Magna). The idea that this has Sumerian writing on it didn't arise
          until Mario Monta&ntilde;o Arag&oacute;n published an article in 1979
          (Ra&iacute;ces sem&iacute;ticas en la religiosidad aymar&aacute; y
          kichua).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the origin of the bowl is quite murky. We don't know where or when
          the bowl was really found. We don't know what it looked like either;
          some sites claim the bowl was restored at one point, while some don't.
          We know who maybe found it if it's indeed the same bowl, but the
          interview was some 40 years after the fact. So there's a forest of red
          flags going up here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The origin might be shady, but does it have Sumerian or Sumerian
          proto-writing on it then? Much of the translation and interest in the
          bowl seems to originate from Hugh Bernard Fox and&nbsp; Clyde Ahmad
          Winters. While Fox claims it to be Phonecian, Winters, an Afrocentric
          scholar claiming the Olmec from Africa, declares it to be Sumerian or
          Proto-Sumerian. We often encounter Winters's supposed translation
          online, but Fox's and Winter's supposed translations are, at best,
          wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Carl Faegan has done a great job comparing Clyde Winters's suggested
          translation to the Sumerian signs. He noted that almost all suggested
          transliteration doesn't match the known Sumerian alphabet. Some
          characters don't even exist, and in those cases, Clyde Winter has just
          declared them Proto-Sumerian and translated them. Faegan points out
          that wedges are pointing in the wrong direction. The sign rotates
          randomly, and it seems to have been written by someone who saw
          Sumerian once, but when created, this did not have it in front of them
          any longer.
        </p>
        <p>Clyde Winters suggested transliteration is:</p>
        <p>
          Ti Kur kur kur kur (determinative for divine names) Nia (lit. ni-ash)
        </p>
        <p>Pa en ash sa tur</p>
        <p>Zi esh, Esh esh, esh esh.</p>
        <p>Pap pa ge Lu ta mi du lu ta</p>
        <p>Bar nu ash</p>
        <p>Ash ti en</p>
        <p>Winters suggested translation is:</p>
        <p>
          "Approach in the future (one) endowed with great protection the great
          Nia."
        </p>
        <p>
          [The Divine One Nia(sh) to] Establish Purity, Establish Gladness,
          Establish Character"
        </p>
        <p>
          "[Use this talisman (the Fuente bowl)] To sprout [oh] diviner the
          unique advise [at] the temple."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The righteous shrine, anoint (this) shrine, anoint (this) shrine; The
          leader takes an oath [to] Establish purity, a favorable oracle (and
          to) Establish character. [Oh leader of the cult] Open up a unique
          light [for all], [who] wish for a noble life".
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither the transliteration nor the translation make much sense.
          Tiwanaku art is on the bowl, but the so-called Sumerian script is
          non-sensical. So what we have is a fake and not a very good one
          either.&nbsp;
