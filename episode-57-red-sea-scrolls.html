          This time, we will continue our examination of the pyramids of Ancient
          Egypt, especially the Great Pyramid of Khufu. We will investigate the
          queen's pyramids, take a trip with Khufu's sun boat, and sit down and
          read the Red Sea scrolls. Ultimately, we will see that this marvel of
          human engineering was indeed done by a workforce organized by Khufu.

          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in
          popular media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 57, and I am Fredrik. Your humble instructor who
          will help you dance on the Ockhams Razors' edge. This time, we will
          continue our examination of the pyramids of Ancient Egypt, especially
          the Great Pyramid of Khufu. We will investigate the queen's pyramids,
          take a trip with Khufu's sun boat, and sit down and read the Red Sea
          scrolls. Ultimately, we will see that this marvel of human engineering
          was indeed done by a workforce organized by Khufu.

          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="dates">Layers of dating the pyramids</h2>
        <p>
          Even if we did cover some methods to date the pyramid of Khufu in the
          last episode, I will continue to demonstrate the different sources we
          can use to date the pyramid's age. Because the age is often something
          used by the ancient alien and ancient astronaut proponents as a sort
          of smoking gun. This idea mainly builds on looking at only part of the
          evidence, cherrypicking data to present a preferred narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >According to most Egyptologists, this miracle of engineering was
            constructed during a 20-year period by order of the pharaoh Khufu,
            sometime around 2500 BC. But many experts claim this dating is based
            on highly questionable data, and ancient astronaut theorists suggest
            the origins of the three pyramids at Giza are far more profound.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          As usual, we are rarely given what this questionable data is. Sure, as
          a television program, they have some limits on what they can present.
          But this isn't really something we get to learn when looking at the
          books written by Von Däniken, David Childress, Giorgio Sukolos, and
          all the other alternative history writers. I think this is because the
          objective evidence is too overwhelming for them to disprove. We have
          already demonstrated how the Great Pyramid fits into the evolution of
          mortuary architecture. How we see elements from earlier mortuary
          buildings Is visible in the Great Pyramid. Let's not forget the
          elements in the Great Pyramids that are visible in later pyramid
          constructions. Then, we have the carbon 14 samples. Since the ancient
          Egyptians used Ash and organic materials in the cement, we can use
          this to date the pyramid.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common claim we often see about the Great Pyramid is that we can't
          date stone. This, however, is a little bit of a half-truth. It is
          correct that we can't use carbon 14 to date the stone. Since stone and
          minerals tend not to be organic materials, however, it is possible to
          date organic material within the rocks. To be fair, organic material
          in granite is as common as a griffin. What we can use to date that
          type of rock is Surface Luminescence Dating. Something that was done
          by Liritzis and Vafiadou and published in the paper "<em
            >Surface Luminescence Dating of Some Egyptian Monuments.</em
          >" The result of this dating method shows that the pyramid of Khufu
          was built within the time frame mainstream archaeology suggests it
          was.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, we have two separate dating methods that return more or less
          the same time period. One of these methods by itself isn't maybe as
          impressive. Upon examining the evidence we have, it becomes
          overwhelming. We have yet to explore evidence surrounding the pyramid.
          Let's broaden our perspective and start by reviewing the two barges
          buried outside the pyramid complex.
        </p>
        <h2 id="khufuship">Khufus sun boats</h2>
        <p>
          In 1954, a fantastic discovery was made. Archaeologists found two
          untouched boat pits that contained the remains of two complete ships.
          Or at least what seemed to be complete vessels. One of the boats was
          left untouched and was just recently excavated. But the other pit was
          excavated. Beneath a large limestone slab was a wholly dismantled
          ship, but with the pieces placed at their position in the boat. Each
          piece was carefully removed from the pit and later assembled. Some
          1224 parts were found, and they had U-shaped holes so they could be
          almost stitched or weaved together, forming this large boat. When
          assembled, it measured 43 meters or 142 feet. And an interesting
          little bit here is that the front and the back look like papyrus
          stalks. So we see here this tradition that started with Djoser, that
          the ancient Egyptians tried to replicate organic reed structure in a
          more durable or enduring material. If you remember, back when we
          talked about Djoser's step pyramid, we spoke about how they within
          this complex are very keen to imitate reed pillars and other organic
          building materials they had used previously.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are more exotic ideas about what these boat pits were used for.
          For example, Christopher Dunn thought it was a place for tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Dunn also believes that the large depressions in the ground at Giza
            are not boat pits as is claimed by mainstream archaeologists, but
            were actually used to hold the 35-foot saws."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"I speculate that they were actually saw pits. The saws were
            mounted in these pits, and that they ran the blocks through the saw
            before they put them in the Great Pyramid."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is a novel idea, this claim simply does not hold up. Or not
          without first proving giant electric milter saws were available to the
          Ancient Egyptians. So, what were these boats used for? And why were
          they disassembled? This is a more relevant question, and there is some
          speculation about it. Some suggest that these vessels were for the
          symbolic transport of the dead pharaoh to the lands of the dead. What
          speaks against this claim is that the boats were disassembled. If it
          had been used for this purpose, the boats would most likely have been
          left in one piece. A more likely explanation is that it is part of the
          funerary rite. So, these ships were used to transport the dead pharaoh
          and possibly the Ka statue To their final resting place. By being a
          part of this funerary procession, the ships became imbued with
          powerful enchantments. The ships were then disassembled and buried
          outside the funerary complex to neutralize the powerful magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, we have some carbon 14 samples done on these boats. And
          guess what? The date again corresponds with the reign of Khufu. So, we
          have yet another piece of evidence pointing towards both the function
          and the date of the pyramid. After the break, we will turn to the
          Queen Pyramids and how they can be used to understand the site.
        </p>
        <h2 id="queenpyramid">The Queens Pyramids</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back! We can look at even more things on the Giza plateau that
          will help us understand the Great Pyramid. For example, the Queen
          Pyramids behind the Khufus Pyramid. So these are smaller pyramids, a
          little bit to the side. One of them is suspected to belong to Queen
          Maritetes. It seems that she lived a long life and was present during
          the reigns of Sneferu, Khufu, and Khafre. The most southern pyramid
          belonged to Queen Henutsen. However, her name has only been preserved
          for us through later dynasties. During the 21st or 26th Dynasty, the
          mortuary temple was converted to a temple dedicated to the goddess
          Isis. During this remodeling, the name is recorded. Then, we have the
          third pyramid, dedicated to Sneferus's wife and Khufu's mother,
          Hetepheres. What's fascinating about this tomb is that we found the
          chamber, well, let's say, somewhat intact. It is quite the story and a
          little bit of a mystery. Mark Lehner describes this well in his book
          "The Complete Pyramids." I can actually see the story work as a great
          movie.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          In 1925, while the lead archaeologist, George Reisner, was away in the
          United States, his team stumbled upon a groundbreaking discovery. His
          photographer almost lost his camera when the ground gave way beneath
          his tripod. This accident revealed a sealed shaft and stairway, hidden
          from the world for over 4,500 years. The effort to clear this passage
          revealed it was not just any shaft; it was extraordinarily deep and
          filled with masonry. Clearing a path was a task that took weeks to
          accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the bottom of this shaft lay a chamber, a final resting place that
          held a beautifully crafted alabaster sarcophagus. Nearby, a small
          alabaster box was found in a niche in the western wall, sealing
          intact. It was a canopic chest meant for the queen's internal organs,
          preserved as if left just yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this burial site revealed signs of disturbance: pottery
          shattered, linen disintegrated, and remnants of boxes that once held
          precious items. The scene suggested a reburial, perhaps in haste or
          under circumstances of duress. Among the debris, items of personal and
          ceremonial significance were discovered: poles of a canopy bearing the
          elegance of early papyrus bud columns, pieces of furniture adorned
          with gold foil, and personal adornments such as silver bracelets.
          These relics spoke of a queen's private life, stature, and the
          sophisticated craftsmanship of the era.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unfolding mystery deepened with the discovery of names tied to the
          royal lineage of Egypt. Initial findings bore the name of Sneferu, but
          soon, other inscriptions revealed the identity of Hetepheres,
          celebrated as "Mother of the King" and "Daughter of the God." These
          discoveries painted a picture of Hetepheres' prominence, her role as
          the wife of Sneferu, and the mother of a king. Seal impressions and
          the Horus name of Khufu among the artifacts added layers to the
          narrative, suggesting familial ties and royal succession.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the grandeur of the find, the sarcophagus stood empty, a
          silent testament to a mystery that puzzled Reisner and later scholars.
          The arrangement of the chamber's contents, contrary to traditional
          burial practices, fueled speculation. Was Hetepheres originally laid
          to rest at Dahshur, only for her tomb to be violated and her remains
          lost? Did Khufu orchestrate a reburial at Giza, in a concealed shaft,
          to protect his mother's legacy? Or does the evidence point to other
          explanations related to royal succession disputes or the
          reorganization of burial rites? We should focus on these enigmas, not
          the invented alien conspiracies.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, we have covered some physical evidence left out of these
          pseudo-archaeological narratives. There's also material based on text
          that we have not looked at yet. Making this claim entirely irrelevant.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Archaeologists and Egyptologists claim that they were tombs for the
            pharaohs, and yet no Egyptian pharaoh was ever found in a pyramid in
            Egypt. We have found the mummies of many Egyptian pharaohs, but
            they're found in vaults deep underground at the Valley of the Kings
            in Luxor, hundreds of miles away from the pyramids. The pyramids
            have no real explanation of what their purpose was.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          As I have mentioned before, there have been human remains found in the
          pyramids. Not necessarily the Great Pyramid, but others have. We don't
          require human remains to be there to see that this was a burial. For
          example, human remains tend to decompose quickly in acidic soil. So,
          in some locations, it's rare to find skeletal remains. But this
          doesn't mean we still can't identify burial sites. It can be done
          through grave goods or mortuary architecture, such as building cairns
          or other grave markers like pyramids.
        </p>
        <h2 id="pyramidtext">Pyramid Texts</h2>
        <p>
          The ancient Egyptians left written records detailing the purpose of
          the pyramids, so we don't have to speculate. Unfortunately, there are
          no pyramid texts within the burials on the Giza Plateau. It wasn't
          until a few hundred years later that these texts appeared carved
          inside the pyramids. I just want to point out that Khufus's name has
          been found carved inside the pyramid by the work gangs building it.
          The first pharaoh to incorporate the pyramid text into their tomb on
          the walls was King Unas, who reigned only around 250 years after
          Khufu. But in this text, we see quotes as.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Any gods who shall cause this pyramid and this construction of the
          King to be good and sturdy, it is they who will be vital, it is they
          who will be respected, it is they who will be impressive, it is they
          who will be in control... it is they who will take possession of the
          crown."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the pyramid text from Pepe the First, we see similar quotes. He
          writes:
        </p>
        <p>
          "As for anyone who shall lay a finger on this pyramid and this temple
          which belong to me and to my double..., he will be judged by the
          Ennead and he will be nowhere and his house will be nowhere; he will
          be one proscribed, one who eats himself."
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just two quotes from the pyramid text. However, we can see
          five categories within the more extensive text corpus of the pyramid
          texts. We have the dramatic texts, which include spells for various
          categories such as lament and offerings. In the second category, we
          find hymns and name formulae. We have litanies in category three; in
          category four, it's all about glorifying the pharaoh. Then, we have
          magical text protections against snakes, scorpions, or other dangerous
          beings. It is most likely that the magical texts are the oldest, but
          previous versions of them have not been preserved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose you are interested in learning more about pyramid texts and
          what's referred to as the Book of the Dead. In that case, I go through
          all of this in an earlier episode. That was in episode 47, titled
          "Mummies, vampires, draugr, and aliens." So, based on all of this, we
          should be able to safely assume that this was constructed as an
          intended burial. As luck would have it, however, recent excavations
          have shed even more light on the construction of the pyramids. More on
          that after these short messages.
        </p>
        <h2 id="redseascroll">The Red Sea Scrolls</h2>
        <p>
          The evidence, however, was not found in or around Giza. We actually
          have to travel a bit to the south. and to the coast of the Red Sea.
          Only 23 kilometers south of Zafarna is an archaeological site called
          Wadi el-Jarf. This seaport started to be excavated in 2011 by a team
          led by Mark Lehner and Pierre Tallet. Initially, nobody would maybe
          guess that this site would become as vital as it would. I also want to
          mention that this section is mainly based on the book "Red Sea
          Scrolls: How ancient papyri reveal the secret of the pyramids." For
          those interested in Egyptology, Tallet and Lehner's book offers a
          deeper understanding of the background and significance of the site
          and the find. I highly recommend reading this book at some point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wadi el-Jarf wasn't a permanent settlement and was used only for a
          relatively brief period of Egyptian history. So, the first time this
          site was used was during the reign of Sneferu. And in total, it would
          only be used for about 70 years. It was used during the reign of Khufu
          and later Khafre. But why? Why did they establish this seaport? As
          discussed briefly in the last episode, copper was necessary for the
          pyramid's construction. Lehner and Teller explain the reason for the
          location as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The pharaonic state was therefore regularly obliged to organize major
          expeditions into the desert areas that surrounded Egypt in order to
          obtain sufficient quantities of this raw material. There are copper
          mines in the Egyptian Eastern Desert, and some deposits in particular
          were exploited in ancient times in the Wadi Araba, a natural route
          leading directly to Wadi el-Jarf."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the seaport was constructed to be a part of these expeditions. As
          things turn out, it seems this part is one of the older ports built
          during the Old Kingdom. Lehner and Teller Also claim there are several
          reasons why this location was chosen. They write the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The site of Wadi el-Jarf has several advantages that make it
            suitable as the location for an 'intermittent port' on the Red Sea
            coast, at a time when the Egyptians were clearly conducting their
            first experiments with this kind of installation. For the port to
            operate most efficiently, it was essential that there was access to
            a supply of good drinking water, which was probably provided by a
            spring at what is now St Paul's Monastery, 10 km from the site</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, this port itself is part of all the evidence we have of the
          construction of the pyramids. But what sets this location aside from
          other places is the team's discovery. While they found a lot of
          materials and equipment belonging to workers. One discovery was maybe
          a little bit more critical. The remains of papyri belong to the
          bureaucratic administration of ancient Egypt. You are likely already
          familiar with some of these documents, often called Merer's diary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The archive Consists of at least five papyri. These are log books and
          are pretty detailed. So, from the logs, we can tell that they most
          likely cover one calendar year that stretches from the 13th census of
          the reign of Khufu. The 13th census corresponds more or less with the
          years 26 to 27 of Khufu's reign, and it also seems to cover the
          beginning of the year corresponding with the 14th census. The logbook
          covers the work gang "<em
            >The Escort Team of "The Uraeus of Khufu is its Prow</em
          >.<em>""</em>
          This group of workers consisted of about 160 men divided into smaller
          groups of phyles or, in Egyptian, "za." The most known of these
          documents are papyri A, B, and C regarding the phyle called
          <em>Great </em>or, in Egyptian, "weret." Led by the middle manager
          Merer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This type of arrangement of workers is known to us from, for example,
          the construction of Pharaoh Menkaure's pyramid. From our sources, it
          seems that Menkaure's workforce consisted of some 2,000 people, then
          split up into two gangs comprised of 1,000 people each, and we even
          have the names of these two gangs. The first is Friends of Menkaure,
          and the second is Drunkards of Menkaure. These packs were then split
          up into smaller groups and phyles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something interesting about the Red Sea scrolls is that none covered
          December and March. So Lehner and Teller speculate that the workforce
          likely got time off to be with their families during this time. Of
          course, this indicates that the workers probably were well cared for.
          Most of Merer's log books seem to cover his work prior to arriving at
          Wadi el-Jarf. So initially, it appeared that the team was delivering
          stone from the Tura Quarry to the Great Pyramid. If you don't recall,
          the Tura Limestone's exceptional quality was utilized for the casing
          of the pyramids. These log books are mostly pretty dry, important, but
          a little bit dry. Most of the entries go as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Day 25] [Inspector Merer spends the day with his phyle [h]au[ling]
          st[ones in Tura South]; spends the night at Tura South. [Day 26]:
          Inspector Merer casts off with his file from Tura [South], loaded with
          stone, for Akhet Khufu; spends the night at She Khufu; Day 27: Sets
          sail from She Khufu, sails towards Akhet Khufu, loaded with stone,
          spends the night at Akhet Khufu."
        </p>
        <p>
          These parts are not the most thrilling read, but they still give a
          great insight into how the stones were delivered to the Great Pyramid
          and how long things took. Some entries are a bit more detailed; Lehner
          describes the entries as "Merer only seems to expand the scope of his
          reports when, for one reason or another, the team departs from the
          standard 'routine' of work. This happens, for example, in Papyrus B,
          when Merer does not return at the expected time to deliver a load of
          stones from Tura, the reason being that in the meantime he had
          obviously been requisitioned to undertake a task elsewhere (at Ro-She
          Khufu) that had not previously been planned. Consequently, he finds it
          necessary to report the delay." So, these papyri demonstrate how
          organized the ancient Egyptian bureaucracy and society was.
        </p>
        <p>
          These documents also confirm that the ancient Egyptians built canals
          from the Nile to the Giza plateau. So, from Merer's description, it
          seems as if they unloaded the Toura limestone at the valley temple.
          Indicating that the causeway that went from the temple to the pyramid
          functioned as a ramp for the Toura Limestone deliveries. Merer also
          described how they dug channels and other work needed to make these
          transports flow as planned. So, these documents are a treasure trove
          and one of the key pieces within the puzzle of the Great Pyramid. From
          these papyri, we also learn that the pyramid was built by and for
          Khufu as his final resting place.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all of this information we have covered, it's tough to argue that
          the pyramids of ancient Egypt were not burials. Yet I want to bring up
          a last claim by the ancient astronaut theorists because this is one
          you will often see when they talk about pyramids.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"When you look at the Great Pyramid as a schematic, for me, it
            looks like a machine. Well, if that's the case, what did this
            machine do? I propose that the Egyptians built the Great Pyramid to
            be a power plant and that the pyramids were actually geomechanical
            devices. In other words, they were attached to the Earth. They were
            tuned to vibrate with the frequencies of the Earth, and they
            converted the energies of the Earth into electromagnetic
            energy."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Something interesting about the Great Pyramid is that it has three
          separate Chambers. We have one chamber that goes down into the
          bedrock, a second chamber between these three chambers, and the burial
          chamber high up in the pyramid. It's only the Great Pyramid that
          really has this layout of chambers. Only Khufu has his chambers this
          high up in the pyramids. The ensuing pyramid constructions usually
          have the chambers grouped at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while these three chambers might look strange in how they are set
          up, they aren't that strange if you're familiar with ancient Egyptian
          Mortuary architecture. If you look at the previous and following
          burial chambers, we see a similar concept. We have three chambers.
          Even if they are not split up as Khufu did, we still have three
          chambers. One seems to be the burial chamber where we have the
          sarcophagus and all of that, and then we have a chamber for the
          Ka-statue, and then the third chamber. Mark Lehner writes about the
          third chamber in the Great Pyramid, "<em
            >There is evidence, however, that all three chambers were planned
            from the beginning, based on a long tradition, before and after
            Khufu, of royal tombs having three chambers. If so, what, then, was
            the purpose of the Subterranean Chamber? Some Egyptologists suggest
            that its rough, unfinished state may indicate a link to the chaotic
            aspect of the Afterlife, making it an earthly symbolic
            representation of the Underworld cavern.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          So again, looking back at all our evidence, Dunn's theory simply does
          not hold up. The ancient alien theorists also haven't demonstrated
          that this type of engine built in stone is even theoretically
          possible. While speculations can be fun, there needs to be evidence at
          one point. Egyptologists have collected evidence for centuries, and
          all this data points toward these structures being burials for the
          kings. Even if we look at only the Great Pyramid, things do not align
          with what the ancient astronauts' supporters say. Nor do they make a
          good case for discrediting the evidence other than claiming it does
          not exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          So there we have it, the Egyptian pyramids were built by an organized
          and well-equipped workforce. They were taken care of and seemed to
          have had much pride in their work. We don't need aliens or Atlanteans
          to explain these constructs. All the evidence points in the same
          direction. While there are some holes in the story, like the exact
          ramp structure used in the Great Pyramid, there are ample theories
          that work better than levitation guns. It's not a question of whether
          a ramp is being used, as we have seen several of them found at the
          location. Add to this that the larger stones are at the bottom, and as
          we go up, they become smaller, something you don't need to do if you
          have levitation devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, there it is. The mystery of the pyramid is an illusion created by
          those who benefit by having it that way. Isn't that ironic?
