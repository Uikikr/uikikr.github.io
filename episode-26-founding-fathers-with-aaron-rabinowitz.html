          This time we will go to some new territories and explore the Founding
          Fathers, aliens and philosophy. To make sense of all this, we have
          Aaron Rabinowitz, a philosopher, and lecturer at Rutgers University.
          He writes a column in

          We're discussing the Plurality of worlds theory, exploring the
          conspiracies in Washington DC, and how to meet people believing in
          these strange claims. It's an exciting and thoughtful journey through
          history and philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode is based on the claims in Ancient Aliens episode eleven
          of season three called "Aliens and The Founding Fathers" (S03E11).

        <h3>Washington&rsquo;s Vision</h3>
        <p>
          In this episode, they bring up Washington's vision. This was an event,
          according to the show, that supposedly happened at Valley Forge in
          Pennsylvania during the winter of 1777. This was the height of the
          Revolutionary war. The continental forces were struggling with the
          cold and get the supplies they needed. Up to 2000 soldiers died during
          this encampment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how could Washington keep his forces motivated? How did he not
          surrender? Could it be that he had extraterrestrial visitors that
          shared knowledge with him? If you ask the Ancient Alien crowd the
          answer is of course yes. Washington had a vision that he would win
          this war and it was influenced by aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing we would want to do in these situations is to see if
          the event really did happen. There&rsquo;s no doubt that Washington
          was at Vally Forge during the winter of 1777 to 1778. It was indeed a
          challenging encampment that the soldier suffered through. But when it
          comes to the vision things start to become a bit dubious. We find it
          in print for the first time in the &ldquo;Union Casket&rdquo;, a
          periodical for Union Soldiers. This was in April of 1881, at the start
          of the Civil War.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It was written by Charles Wesley Alexander under the pen name, Wesley
          Bradshaw. It was never meant to be a true account of something
          Washington experienced but more as an inspirational story. Charles did
          write a couple of these types of stories about different people from
          American history. None of it was meant to be taken literary and I
          think you will see this too if you read the full account.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>Green Skins</h3>
        <p>
          But it was not just visions Washinton experienced. In his war
          journals, according to Ancient Aliens, he describes what seems to be
          direct contact with extraterrestrial life. But it seems as if
          Washington was not really aware of this. In the journals, he describes
          a group of Native Americans with green skins that came with
          information about the British movements.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we need to again figure out where this claim comes from and if
          it&rsquo;s possible to read these diaries. But this turned out to be
          harder than one first thought. But there are a few names that you will
          encounter in most of these retellings and you&rsquo;ll soon realize
          that they all build on the exact same source.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The author's name of the article is Basil Hill and it&rsquo;s usually
          claimed that this was originally written in The Sun. The year or any
          other dates of publication is never revealed in these instances. But
          I&rsquo;ve not been able to locate any article with The Sun containing
          the information we get. Basil Hill is quite non-existent online except
          for in the instances when the &ldquo;article&rdquo; is published. The
          same is for the author or researcher or historian Quentin Burde in
          Edinburgh, Scotland. That different web pages give this individual
          different titles is usually cause for some alarm. But it&rsquo;s also
          a person who seems to have no Internet presence except in relation to
          the article <em>George Washington and the &ldquo;greenies.&rdquo;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it possible to find the origin? Some of the &ldquo;reprints&rdquo;
          contained a little bit of text, at the end, stating &ldquo;<em
            >This information has been taken from The BBS Archive CD Rom.</em
          >&rdquo; In this case, BBS stands for Bulletin Board System, and even
          if I didn&rsquo;t find the CD I found other articles with this phrase.
          All of those are leading to a now-defunct site called
          <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120402120434/http://www.book-of-thoth.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >book-of-thoth.com</a
          >. The way back machine only contains a couple of snapshots of the
          start page but it seems to have been a &ldquo;paranormal research
          forum&rdquo; where users could post their ideas as at any other online
          forum. Some of these &ldquo;research&rdquo; threads were converted to
          articles and published on some sort of CD.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So did Washington encounter a green-skinned tribe of Native Americans
          who helped him win the war? Most likely not.
        </p>
        <h3>Dunbar UFO</h3>
        <p>
          On April the 5th, 1800, a strange event supposedly took place in Baton
          Rouge. An event in the sky was caught by a set of witnesses. In
          Ancient Aliens, it&rsquo;s portrayed that William Dunbar saw this
          event take place and reported this to Vice President Jefferson. Dunbar
          was an astronomer, merchant, and explorer but not a witness to the
          event. Dunbar was reporting something that had been told to him, so we
          are talking about second or third-hand sources.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In this episode we learn that this object was flying really slowly,
          ruling out a meteorite. But if we again start to look at the sources
          we learn the following.
        </p>
        <p>&ldquo;<em>It was first seen in the South West, and</em></p>
        <p><em>moved so rapidly, passing over the heads</em></p>
        <p><em>of the spectators, as to disappear in the</em></p>
        <p><em>North East in about a quarter of a minute.</em>&rdquo;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>William Dunbar 1804</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It does not really cope with what we&rsquo;re told in the episode.
          From the sound of the original article, it seems to be a smaller
          meteor, or it could be something else. Unfortunately, we don&rsquo;t
          have whatever crashed preserved or described in greater detail. But
          it&rsquo;s more likely to be a natural cause for it than an
          extraterrestrial. The description of the result of a loud crash
          doesn&rsquo;t really correspond with an alien craft crashing. A small
          meteorite on the other hand might be a more likely scenario.&nbsp;
