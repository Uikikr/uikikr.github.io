        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Adelsö and into the world of the Vikings. We stand in a
          landscape that has been under constant change since the giant Ice Age
          glaciers retreated thousands of years ago. It is here that our story
          begins in the sea. With the massive glaciers gone, the land slowly
          rose from the dark waters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, Adelsö was just a tiny island in a growing archipelago. But
          it wasn't long before humans settled here, drawn by its strategic
          location and new resources. From their remains, we can see that these
          immigrants primarily lived off fishing and seal hunting.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the landscape would continue to change. New eras would
          introduce new technologies, materials, and contacts far beyond little
          Adelsö. Each advancement, from the use of stone to copper and then to
          bronze, marked a significant shift in the island's history. Times of
          unrest came, and iron replaced bronze, further shaping Adelsö's
          development. Two hill fortifications were built on Adelsö, one at
          Skansenberget and one at Gladhamn, a testament to the island's
          strategic importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our saga here continues at the end of the Iron Age, a time of
          exploration and long-distance contacts and a time when much was
          changing in what would become Sweden. The period we will explore here
          in the area will mostly take place during the Vendel period and the
          Viking Age. Let us now step into history.
        </p>

        <h2 id="mounds">Mounds</h2>
        <p>
          Before you now rise the so-called royal mounds. Although they do not
          reach the impressive dimensions of the famous mounds at Gamla Uppsala,
          these graves bear important testimony to the significance of this
          site. These monumental graves were intended for the most prominent
          members of society. The ones before us have not yet been explored
          through excavations, leaving the identities of those resting within
          shrouded in mystery. We hope these graves are undisturbed from
          looting, allowing future research to offer us more profound insights.

        <p>
          Burial customs during the Viking Age varied greatly, and there was no
          uniform burial system. For example, at Birka, located just across the
          water, we have discovered chamber graves, a method where a chamber was
          dug out and furnished for the deceased. Eleven such graves have been
          found at Birka, all filled with stones, raising the question of
          whether they were once covered by burial mounds that have collapsed
          over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also find other types of graves, such as flat graves, ship burials,
          and simpler earth burials without any ceremonial additions. Burial
          mounds, a tradition that dates back to the Neolithic period, have
          continued to be a part of the burial tradition through the Bronze Age
          and into the Iron Ages, including the Viking Age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particularly during the Vendel period and the Viking Age, it was
          popular to erect what we call Royal Mounds; notable examples include
          those at Gamla Uppsala and Anundshög near Västerås. These impressive
          burial mounds, which also include Högom in Medelpad and Nordian's
          mound in Uppland, among others, differ from other mounds in their
          size. A mound is considered a royal mound if it has a diameter of at
          least 30 meters. Those more prominent than 20 meters but smaller than
          30 meters are classified as large mounds. This tradition of large
          mounds began already in the Bronze Age but became particularly notable
          during the Vendel and Viking periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let us continue our walk toward one of the excavated mounds to
          explore more about life and death during this fascinating era.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Skopintull">Skopintull</h2>
        <p>
          Now we stand before the mound known as Skopintull. This name sparks
          curiosity and has led to various theories about its origin. Does the
          name come from the idea that this was where people changed into their
          Sunday shoes before attending church? Could it be linked to the
          Russian raids, or is there perhaps a completely different explanation
          behind the name? What is known is that this mound was excavated under
          the leadership of one of Sweden's first female archaeologists, Hannah
          Rydh, amid the raging world war in 1917.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the excavation was carried out in 1917, it wasn't until 1936
          that Rydh published her findings. And it would take even longer, until
          2013, before some of the mound's mysteries began to be unveiled.
          During her excavations, Rydh discovered a layer of burnt material rich
          in bone remains, totaling up to 36 kilos, from horses, dogs, and even
          a cat. Additionally, there were bones from pigs, sheep, cows, and
          various bird species, including sea eagle, goshawk, chicken, and
          crane. Interestingly, osteological evidence of two humans, likely a
          man and a woman, was also found, but exactly who the mound was
          intended for remains unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The grave goods discovered were considerably rich, including bridles,
          combs, knives, game pieces, and a shield. The clothes of the buried
          individuals appeared to have origins from the Orient, richly decorated
          with gold thread. The ceremony seems to have been conducted by placing
          the bodies and goods in a boat, which was then set on fire. The
          collected remains were placed in a copper kettle, which was examined
          more closely in 2013, where researchers found an egg and a lock of
          hair, the significance of which and whom the hair belonged to remain a
          mystery.

          This grave clearly indicates that those who rest here were part of the
          society's upper class. Based on the items in the grave, we know these
          individuals lived during the first half of the 10th century.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it's time to leave Skopintull behind and continue our journey
          through history towards encountering a new religion that would
          profoundly and enduringly shape Sweden.
        </p>

        <h2 id="new-religion">The New Religion</h2>
        <p>
          Before us stands a clear symbol of change in the Viking Age society.
          The contacts with the continent introduced not only new techniques and
          goods to Scandinavia but also new ideas and gods. The Christianization
          of Scandinavia was a long and complex process. While threats of
          violence likely occurred, the conversion did not take place by sword
          or axe. Instead, Christianity crept in through trade, missions, and
          interactions with thralls. When a new, more potent royal power
          embraced the new faith, it began to drive the Europeanization of
          Sweden, establishing laws that compelled people to adopt Christianity,
          which accelerated the conversion. Olof Skötkonung was the first
          Christian king of Sweden who actively promoted the new faith by
          minting coins and proselytization.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the official embrace of Christianity, traces of the old Norse
          religion survived quietly, and it is unclear when it finally
          disappeared completely, mainly due to laws that forbade pagan
          practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking closer at the building before us, we see it is a classic
          medieval hall church, characteristic of its time. This means it has a
          nave and chancel of the same height without a distinct separation
          between these two parts—a detail you can observe if you go inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are theories that a wooden church once stood on this site, but
          no physical evidence has yet been found. We do know that the first
          stone church here was likely ordered to be built by the king at the
          end of the 12th century, initially without a bell tower and with a
          narrower nave and a lower chancel with an apse in the shape of a
          semicircle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first major reconstruction occurred in the 14th century when the
          church was expanded to its current appearance, and a tower was added.
          A wooden porch was also built in the 14th century, but after a fire,
          it was reconstructed in the 17th century. During the 18th century, the
          church bells were moved from an external belfry into the tower, and in
          the 19th century, the porch was demolished, and the entrance was moved
          to its current location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the church, we find the baptismal font, one of the few
          furnishings from the church's early days. Simple in its design and
          made of coarse sandstone in the 12th century, it is one of the few
          furnishings from the church's early days. If you look up towards the
          sacristy, you'll notice a crucifix from the 14th century above the
          door. Inside the sacristy is another crucifix from the 14th century,
          originally part of a now-lost altarpiece.
        </p>

        <h3 id="sacristy-runestones">Sacristy’s Runestones</h3>
        <p>
          Now that we are in the sacristy, let's look at the north wall. Here,
          we can see two runestones embedded in the wall. There was also a third
          runestone in the church, which unfortunately was lost in the porch
          fire. The surviving stones are labeled U 1 and U 10.
        </p>
        <p>
          The left stone, U 10, its origin is somewhat mysterious; it was found
          in a gravel pit and brought to the church. The stone has two lines of
          text which read, "Aft Øpi standi stæinn saʀ ok Lokki(?) gærði." In
          modern Swedish, this translates to "The stone was raised after Öpir,
          and Lokki made [it]." The stone has been broken off, but we can assume
          that Lokki was the one who carved it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The right stone, U 1, is probably younger, based on the serpent loop
          design. The inscription reads “Æskell let retta stæin þenna [æ]f[tiʀ]
          …, faður sinn, [b]o[nd]a goðan.” In Swedish, this teaches us that
          Äskell raised the stone in memory of his father, who was a good man.
        </p>
        <p>Let us now leave the church and continue to our next site.</p>

        <h2 id="old-harbour">The Old Harbour</h2>
        <p>
          We stand in a place where land elevation has transformed the landscape
          over millennia. The year we return to is 1075, and at that time, the
          water was a full six meters higher than today. This means that during
          the Viking Age, the water's edge was just a short distance from where
          we now stand. Here, archaeologists have uncovered remnants of what was
          once a quay.
        </p>
        <p>
          One can only imagine what this harbor must have been like, with ships
          arriving to unload their goods, and missionaries, soldiers, and
          diplomats stopping by. Against this backdrop, erecting a runestone
          here would have been a great honor, likely reserved only for
          distinguished individuals. The six-ton runestone we stand before tells
          a somewhat different story.

          As you approach the stone, let yourself be captivated by the exquisite
          craftsmanship and richness of detail in the runemaster's work. The
          dragon loop that encircles the stone and bites its own tail is an
          artistic expression and a time marker. Just as fashion trends shift
          over time, this loop reflects a style known as the middle Urnes style,
          or PR4, for those more academically inclined. Researchers have been
          able to distinguish eight different styles which can help us date
          runestones. Thanks to this style, we can determine the years the stone
          could have been made and which king might be mentioned on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's important to note that the red paint now highlighting the runes
          is a modern addition, intended to make the inscriptions stand out for
          us. Originally, the stone was an explosion of colors, decorated in
          black, white, and red, which made it a striking sight for all who
          arrived at the harbor.
        </p>
        <p>The inscription on the stone tells a fascinating story:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Rað þu runaʀ. Rätt lät rista Toliʀ bryti i roði kunungi. Toliʀ ok
            Gylla letu ris[ta] …, þaun hion æftiʀ [si]k(?) mærki … Hakon bað
            rista."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Translated, it reads:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Interpret the runes. The right to carve them for the king was
            granted by Tolir, the steward in Roden. Tolir and Gylla, the couple,
            had this monument raised in their memory. Håkon ordered the
            carving."
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          What is interesting about this stone is that Tolir refers to himself
          as a 'bryte,' a particular class of thrall or slave. Like in some
          other cultures, slaves in Viking society could become free. However,
          there was a catch; even if they became free, and we have examples like
          Toki, who we know was freed, they still held the same legal status.
          Once a thrall, always a thrall. But it is worth noting that Tolir,
          with his position, had quite a bit of power even though he was not a
          free man.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may explain why Tolir emphasizes that he had the right and
          permission to erect the stone. Slaves also did not have the right to
          marry, which may suggest that Tolir had become free but retained his
          title.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Viking Age view of class and beauty adds another layer to this
          story. Unlike today's society, where class is often associated with
          economy and inheritance, Vikings also highly valued physical beauty,
          especially among men. This idea can be clearly seen in myths and
          legends such as in the work 'Rígsþula.' In this text, the aesthetic
          aspect of social hierarchy is highlighted, from the humble ugly thrall
          to the noble, beautiful Earl. The one who created the classes was
          Heimdall, who shared a bed with three families who had different
          physical attributes. The result is that the thrall is ugly and suited
          for simple tasks, free men become robust and healthy, and the Earl
          becomes the most beautiful person in the world. That is why Skalds
          always made sure to find something that could be described as
          beautiful on the Earl.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this brief text written on the stone, we can open a window to
          the past, glimpsing the everyday life and values of those who lived
          during the Viking Age. Let us now continue our journey.

        <h2 id="harbour-defence">Harbour Defence During the Viking Age</h2>
        <p>
          If we had been transported back to the Viking Age and stood here
          without a boat, we would have found ourselves in the middle of the
          water! Where we now stand, in the heart of the historic harbor area of
          Alsnö, was once a bustling center of maritime commerce and trade. If
          you look out over the water now, it may seem calm and empty. But
          archaeologists have discovered a fascinating defensive structure made
          of stakes. These stakes are believed to have been part of a protective
          barrier strategically designed to prevent enemy ships from attacking
          the harbor freely. The defensive system forms a semicircle in the
          water, with a deliberate opening - a channel that allows ships to
          enter the harbor one at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's possible that this structure also served a dual function as a
          breakwater, protecting the harbor from storms and high waves. This is
          a testament to the engineering prowess of the Viking Age and their
          ability to create structures that served multiple purposes – both
          practical and defense-related.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us now leave the secrets of the water behind and walk upwards,
          towards the once majestic Alsnö house.
        </p>

        <h2 id="alsno-castle">Alsnö Castle</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to what was once a royal palace – today, perhaps merely a
          shadow of its former self, but 800 years ago, this site was dominated
          by an impressive three-story building. By the architectural standards
          of the time, this was truly a spectacle. The foundation, which remains
          can still be seen, is made of stone, while the palace it self was made
          out of brick – a material regarded as both novel and luxurious at the
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stories are etched into its walls and in the materials used. For
          example, a proud master builder named Bovæ left his mark on a brick
          carved in runes, not once but twice. Showing that runes were still
          used in this area during what we would call the Middle Ages.

        <p>
          The earliest evidence of Alsnö House's origins is coins found on the
          site, the oldest dating to the reign of Valdemar Birgersson between
          1266 and 1275. Archaeologists discovered the coin among the stones,
          indicating it was dropped during construction. The palace was likely
          built over the earlier royal manor. However, neither post holes nor
          other remnants of the former royal manor have been found.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alsnö House extended 30 meters in length and 14 meters wide. Its
          ground floor holds traces of grandeur, evidenced by ornately decorated
          brick floor tiles and an impressive fireplace. A brick wall separated
          part of the room, and in the western part of the building, wooden
          floors were discovered, the remains of which Bengt Thordeman found
          charred during excavations in 1920.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oldest known depiction of Alsnö House, from a survey map dated to
          1751, shows a building with a gateway tower and barrel vaults. This,
          along with architectural comparisons and historical documents, has led
          to new insights into what the building might have looked like.
          Previously, it was believed that the palace had only two floors, but
          now it is thought to likely have had three.
        </p>
        <p>
          The architectural inspiration behind Alsnö House seems to have been
          Håkon Håkonson's palace building in Bergen, known as Håkonshallen or
          Bergenhus, completed in 1251. The similarities between these two regal
          buildings perhaps underscore Magnus Ladulås's desire to erect an
          equally impressive palace. The main difference is that Håkonshallen
          also features a defensive tower, which has not been found at Adelsö.
          However, two stone-walled cellars have been rediscovered just west
          outside the building. The function of the cellars has not yet been
          fully explained, but perhaps they were part of a defensive tower.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Alsnö House is not just a site of architectural admiration. It was
          here that one of Sweden's most significant legal documents, the Alsnö
          Statute, was created under the leadership of Magnus Ladulås. This
          statute changed the foundation of the Swedish nobility by offering tax
          exemption to those who contributed soldiers and warriors and marked
          the end of the nobles' right to demand lodging and food from the
          peasantry without compensation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alsnö House had a short but glamorous heyday. After 1304, no king
          dated a letter from Alsnö, something Ander Ödman attributes to the
          emergence of Stockholm Castle. Stockholm Castle appears to have been
          built around 1300, which would align well with the abandonment of
          Alsnö. However, there is some mystery surrounding the downfall of the
          house. Numerous crossbow bolts have been found around the site, and
          some suggest that the Vitaliebrothers might have burned down the
          house. These German privateers wanted to restore King Albert to the
          throne, but this must have occurred after 1389, indicating that the
          site retained some significance long after 1304.
        </p>

        <h2 id="viking-home">The Viking Home</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome home! Before us stands a reconstructed dwelling inspired by
          what a home might have looked like during the Viking Age. This
          farmstead reflects a typical residence for the free, somewhat
          wealthier, smaller landowners in society. Here we find two or perhaps
          three buildings, which was typical. Some of these farms could also
          have included one or two pit-houses – partially dug-in workshop
          buildings that were an important part of the farm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, we know less about Viking Age dwellings than earlier
          periods in the Iron Age. However, archaeological studies indicate that
          housing patterns were relatively consistent over time. Since the
          Bronze Age, the dominant construction method in Sweden has been the
          three-aisled longhouse. This type of building was supported by several
          pairs of posts that held up the roof, while the walls could be made of
          wattle and daub, earth, turf, or stone – depending on available
          materials. Depending on the size of the house, it could contain
          several sections, including a kitchen area, sleeping quarters,
          stables, storage, as well as rooms for entertainment and living.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towards the end of the Viking Age, around the year 900, a new
          architectural design began to emerge, especially in the southern parts
          of Scandinavia. Here, we find the Trelleborg houses, a type of
          building we see in the Trelleborgs built under the rule of Harald
          Bluetooth in Denmark. These houses were considerably wider than
          earlier ones, up to twelve meters in width, and could also have a
          second floor. On Gotland, another house model began to emerge that was
          smaller in size and had only a central aisle, but the roof was
          supported by strong walls instead of columns as we see in the
          longhouses in Sweden.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sail-and-vikings">The Sail and the Vikings</h2>
        <p>
          Although we can't showcase one of the so-called pit-houses here, they
          represent one of the most fascinating aspects of Viking Age
          innovation. These structures have been linked to the introduction of
          the sail. This invention revolutionized the Scandinavians' way of
          exploring and conquering. The presence of sails in Scandinavia does
          not appear to have been established until the late Iron Age, making
          the term "The Age of Sail" or perhaps "Sail Era" a fitting description
          for the Viking period.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to available sources, the sails were primarily made of wool
          and treated with fat, tallow, or fish oil to make them windproof and
          durable. The process of creating a sail was highly time-consuming.
          Lise Bender Jørgensen has estimated that a wool sail for an average
          longship required about 90 square meters of fabric. Considering that a
          skilled spinner could produce between 30 to 50 meters of yarn per
          hour, this would mean 4800 working hours just for spinning and an
          additional 3200 hours to weave the fabric. This equates to, in modern
          Swedish working hours, four years of work, excluding the time it takes
          to harvest and process the wool. Moreover, considering the need for
          additional equipment for voyages – such as extra sails, tents,
          clothing, and provisions for a crew of up to 32 sailors – it could
          take up to 24 years to fully equip a ship with textiles alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Viking Age was undoubtedly a flourishing period for sheep owners.
          Estimates show that nearly one million square meters of wool were
          needed for this massive production, corresponding to the need for
          approximately two million sheep. This demand for wool led to
          significant societal changes, where small farms merged into larger
          units to streamline production. As we have already mentioned, with the
          new farm structure, we see the pit-houses, where archaeologists have
          found evidence of textile production in the form of loom weights and
          looms. It is unlikely that the free women on the farm performed this
          work; instead, much indicates that it was the responsibility of the
          thralls. The conditions in these weaving houses were harsh, with poor
          light and air filled with wool particles, making the work environment
          both suffocating and unhealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This increased demand for labor to meet the production of sails and
          other necessities may have been one of the driving forces behind the
          Vikings' raiding expeditions. More labor enabled greater production,
          leading to larger armies and the need for even more textiles and
          labor. This created a self-reinforcing cycle, where slaves were
          captured during raids and sold into existing trade networks. By the
          beginning of the 11th century, some Viking fleets could comprise up to
          200 ships. Slavery thus formed a fundamental part of Viking society –
          without slavery, there would be no Viking Age.
