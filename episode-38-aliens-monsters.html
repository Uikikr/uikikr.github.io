          Some people claim that monsters and gods could be evidence for alien
          visitations and that E.T. could have changed and mixed DNA on
          creatures that became gods for ancient people. But is there any truth
          to this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeologist Fredrik is looking into the claims that the Montauk
          Monster found in 2008 could be evidence of this. Or could the monster
          be an ordinary creature distorted by postmortem processes?
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, we look into radioactivity claims in Mohenjo-Daro, an
          archaeological site in today's Pakistan. We will discuss city planning
          and waste management and how a small translation error can create a
          modern legend.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          A creature is washed up on the beach, scaring three local women. Could
          this creature be evidence of alien DNA mutation? Or could the origin
          have been older and part of a radioactive experiment in an ancient
          city, ultimately leading to its doom? Most likely not, but let's find
          out.
        </p>
        <p>Intro</p>
        <p>
          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 38, and it's good to be
          back from my little vacation. I'm all rested, and it's time to dig up
          some dirt on the Ancient Alien theories. This time I watched the
          episode "Aliens and Monsters," the second episode from season three
          (S03E02) initially aired in August 2011. As the episode name might
          hint, it deals with monsters in ancient texts and how they are
          evidence of aliens mixing with DNA trying to create strange hybrids.
          While we could talk a bit about everything they bring up, ranging from
          the Lochness monster to the Indian god Garoda, I've decided to focus
          on solving two things. The Montauk Monster and the claim of radiation
          in Mohenjo-Daro. So strap in because this will be a wild ride.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As usual, you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions on
          our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find contact
          info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And if you
          like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of those fancy
          five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2>Montauk Monster</h2>
        <p>
          The first thing we encounter in this episode is a modern mystery.
          Well, we will soon learn that it's only a mystery if you don't look
          for an answer. You may have heard about this one, the Montauk Monster.
          The Ancient Alien experts, to use the term lose and dangerous,
          describe this creature like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "At actually looked like a hybrid creature, that had the claws of a
          raccoon and possibly the beak of a bird and the body perhaps of a dog.
          A very unusual creature. A photograph is taken and circulated. It
          started popping up all over the internet. It went viral." - Franklin
          Ruehl.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quote is from Franklin Ruehl, who had a Ph.D. in theoretical
          nuclear physics, and another example that a degree doesn't protect you
          from bad ideas. If you don't remember, the monster was "discovered" by
          three women on July 13, 2008, on a beach in Montauk, New York. The
          carcass is furless, with fingerlike paws and what some claim to be a
          beak but with sharp-looking teeth. Looking at the picture available,
          it's not surprising that people believe it to be some sort of monster;
          it looks rather scary. While it has an odd appearance, it's not the
          mystery the show paints it to be. The key to understanding this
          monster lay in understanding Taphonomy. Or, in other words,
          understanding how a body decay after death.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a creature, animal, or human dies, postmortem changes start to
          occur immediately. Different processes kick-off and begin to change
          the body's chemical composition and appearance. Within 21 days from
          the time of death, most carcasses show signs of bloating,
          discoloration, skin slippage, post-bloating rupture, and hair loss. It
          has been noted that animal cadavers in water tend to loosen the fur
          rather quickly, which would explain the almost complete hair loss that
          we can see on the monster.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the beak that we heard mentioned by Franklin Ruehl, the
          explanation can be found in the fact that many of us don't know how
          our noses are constructed. I did have a few courses in osteology, and
          something that's become apparent rather quickly is that the nose bone
          is really short, and a large part of your nose is actually not bone
          but cartilage. There are different types of cartilage throughout your
          body, but in your nose, it's a type of membrane made out of fiber. If
          you take two fingers, close your nostrils, and move the fingers
          upward, you will find the nasal bone. As you might note, it ends close
          to the cranium. The part that sticks out is the cartilage; you might
          feel it's pretty soft and flexible.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This soft cartilage decay quickly after death and is rare in the
          archaeological record. The reason why we have spent some time talking
          about human snoots is that animals have the same construction on their
          sniffers. Sure, the shape might be slightly different, but the
          principle is the same. If we apply a bit of osteology on the carcass,
          looking at the teeth and nasal shape, the head looks like a perfect
          match for a raccoon. A conclusion Palaeozoologist Darren Nash and
          others seems to share. Add the long fingers typical for a raccoon and
          the tail the identification appears to be secure enough.
          Unfortunately, an unknown individual is claimed to have removed the
          carcass, so we might not have a definitive identification of the
          animal. I don't think we have brought up much of Occams razor in the
          past, but it is very much applicable here and in much of what we talk
          about, to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are unfamiliar with this idea, Occam's razor is a
          problem-solving principle stating that the simplest explanation is
          usually the correct one. It's also known as the law of parsimony or
          the principle of parsimony. Occam's razor is named after William of
          Ockham, a 14th-century English philosopher. However, earlier
          philosophers like Duns Scotus and Durandus of Saint-Pour&ccedil;ain
          had similar ideas to Ockham.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occam's razor works by saying that we should prefer the most
          straightforward explanation when we have two or more competing
          explanations for a phenomenon. This is because the simplest
          explanation is the one that is most likely to be correct. For example,
          if we see a footprint in the sand, we could explain it by saying it
          was made by a human, dog, or dinosaur. However, the simplest
          explanation is that it was made by a human, and this is because humans
          are the only known creature to create a footprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occam's razor is not always right, and there are times when the
          simplest explanation is not the correct one. However, it is a helpful
          principle to follow when solving problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also see a common mistake in reporting the Montauk Monster: asking
          the wrong kind of experts. While some reporters did try to reach out
          to people with a zoological background, these were not experts on dead
          animals. Honestly, it's more intricate than you might think to
          identify a piece of bone and attribute it to the proper animal. For
          example, if you head to the episode's webpage, you'll find a picture
          of an animal cranium. Can you correctly identify the species without
          resorting to Google?
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          But why is Ancient Aliens talking about a dead raccoon that somehow
          made the news back in 2008? Well, I'll let Giorgio answer that
          question for us!
        </p>
        <p>
          "If the Montauk Monster is, in fact, a reality, then that could mean
          that if we're able today to create some very bizarre creatures behind
          closed doors in labs all around the world, it is possible that our
          ancestors, especially the extraterrestrial ancestors, had the same
          capability. Because in ancient texts, we have numerous references to
          monsters, bizarre beings that have been described in great detail." -
          Giorgio&nbsp; Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the monster is only a segway by a logical fallacy into the rest of
          the episode. From the beast on the Jersey shore, we head over to Greek
          mythology. They talk about the Chimera, the Hydra, and Cerberus and
          then refer to the Gorgons as a monster. The Gorgons were three sisters
          within Greek mythology, not one creature per se. Maybe a bit of
          hairsplitting there, but we get quotes as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "To suggest that all of these creatures were nothing else but fantasy,
          in my opinion, doesn't really hold water because our ancestors weren't
          stupid. They depicted what they saw. We find these mixed hybrid beings
          all throughout Egypt as sphinxes, as griffons, as bizarre creatures
          that, according to the ancient Egyptian texts, they did exist. They
          were not a fantasy of our ancestors' imagination." - Giorgio&nbsp;
          Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right, the idea that ancient people lacked words to describe things
          adequately or lacked imagination is plain silly. This whole section is
          just frivolous ideas, and we humans are aces when it comes to dreaming
          something up. Our main advantage from an evolutionary perspective is
          that we can imagine things and concepts. While some ancient people
          believed these creatures existed, there's no evidence that they did.
          It's as if the future people would look back and think we living today
          thought witchers were real. While monsters are fun and can be fun
          parts of stories or games, it's not real.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it does not stop von D&auml;niken, Jonathan Young, or Phillip
          Coppens from speculating how and why these creatures were created. It
          seems to boil down to curiousness from the aliens trying to develop a
          master hybrid for their gold mining. But we only get pure
          speculations, not that it will stop the experts from speculating on
          the creatures' origin. To find this, we have to travel across the
          world to the Indus Valley.
        </p>
        <h2>Mohenjo-Daro city planing and sewers</h2>
        <p>
          Greetings! You have arrived at Mohenjo-Daro, an archaeological site in
          the Larkana District of South-Eastern Pakistan. This is far from the
          first time we have visited the site. The first time was back in
          episode 7 with Erik Palmgren, and if you want to listen to that
          episode, you will have to become a member, don't worry; it's 100%
          free. It's pretty new, so the first eight episodes can only be found
          in the members portal from now. Don't worry; I won't use the power of
          paywall for our regular episodes. Maybe some bonus content might end
          there, but I want this show to be as accessible as possible. We also
          visited the Mohenjo-Daro in episode 19 when looking at Nazi alien
          mythology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mohenjo-Daro is described by the cryptozoologist Franklin Ruehl as a
          modern city with parallel streets, advanced sewage systems, and
          toilets in every house. To give Ruehl some credit here, this is kind
          of true. Mohenjo-Daro was advanced for being constructed around 2500
          BCE by people from the Harappan Civilization. Named after the site
          Harappa located in Punjab, Pakistan. The name of the city of
          Mohenjo-Daro translates to "Mound of the dead" or "Mound of Mohan" in
          Sindi, a language spoken in South-Eastern Pakistan. Sindi as a
          language seems to have spread in the Historic sources around 900 CE.
          So the site's name is different from what the inhabitants would have
          called it since the Harappa culture did not develop writing. Even if
          there are some signs of a proto-Indus script, there's not enough
          evidence to state they had writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mohenjo-Daro was, for the time, a large city with, at its peak, some
          40 000 inhabitants. From the look of things, there seems to have been
          a sort of city planning of the city, even if some parts grew
          organically. But there is a clear structure and idea on a larger scale
          over the town. A thing that the inhabitants were quite intuitive about
          was the sewage system. When you construct a large city, you will have
          to deal with a couple of issues. The two more important things are the
          water supply and human waste management. And for the latter, there
          have been many variations, ranging from a hole in the yard that you
          empty with buckets, cesspools, open drainage, or just having it in the
          street that was later washed away into the local river. All of these
          have their issues; cesspools, for example, tend to explode, and open
          drainage comes with quite the smell. Also, washing it down into the
          river can have quite the consequences, as London learned during the
          "Great stink" in 1858.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Mohenjo-Daro, we find a semi-closed drainage system with a
          sophistication that was not beaten until the Roman sewage systems
          thousands of years later. During excavations in Mohenjo-Daro, a
          drainage system was discovered, typically going about 50 centimeters
          below the street level and having a minimum diameter of 15 cm. These
          drains were usually covered by flagstones, wood, or other various
          covers. The sloping is around 2 cm per meter, which is not much, but
          with enough water pouring, the waste should move down the pipes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The question archaeologists ask about this system is what was supposed
          to go in the drains. Many houses have a shallow basin of baked bricks
          connected to the drainage system. But in many of the homes, we also
          find in the same room as the basin latrines with a vertical chute.
          Some seem to aim for either the drain but on the outside of the house
          or a local cesspit. So was the drainage more for grey water left from
          bathing, cleaning, cooking, etc. Or was it designed to wash away
          what's been deposited from the lavatory? But then again, not all the
          toilets were connected to the drains. But it could be argued that if
          not everyone poured water in the gutter, the flow would be too low,
          and the stench would build up in the streets. It might be good to note
          here that some of the more immense palaces were not connected to the
          drains at all.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It's clear that the Harappan people were doing some fascinating
          experimentation but most likely a smelly one. But this part of our
          human past is easy to forget, and it's pretty fun to read the research
          on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it is not really toilets and sewage that brought us to this
          location from the start. The real reason we're here is, of course, due
          to the nuclear explosion that's supposed to have happened here. We
          hear again these strange claims about Mohenjo-Daro and the supposed
          ending of the town.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2>Solving the radioactive Mohenjo Daro</h2>
        <p>
          "Skeletons were found in dead positions as though there's an
          instantaneous death, and some of those skeletons, as measured by
          Soviet scientists, had 50 times the normal radioactivity. They found
          pottery that had been fused, then walls were heated to such an extent
          they became vitrified or glasslike, suggesting some sort of ancient
          nuclear weapon involved." - Franklin Ruehl.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have been listening for a while or are familiar with these
          ideas, what you just heard is nothing new. We have covered these
          claims in the past, so I'll gloss over the skeletons in the streets
          and the fused pottery. Let's focus on where this claim originates
          since I believe it can teach us a valuable lesson in approaching
          sources. m
        </p>
        <p>m</p>
        <p>
          Who was the first person to claim that Mohenjo-Daro was evidence for a
          nuclear explosion? While claims of atomic war appear in "Morning of
          the Magicians," "Chariots of the Gods," and the "Twelth Planet," and
          many other books, these are all based on misread religious texts.
          Something we will return to a bit later. But Mohenjo-Daro is not
          mentioned at all, or not at all, until Charles Berlitz's 1972 book
          "Mysteries from Forgotten Worlds." Berlitz was an American linguist
          who may be most known for his writing on the Bermuda Triangle and the
          Philadelphia experiment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in his 1972 book, Charles wrote on page 128. "It ended in sudden
          conquest and ruin by invaders from the north in about 1500 B.C. so
          suddenly thatskeletons of the slaughtered inhabitants have been found
          pre-served at the old street level." Note that we do not have a
          connection with a nuclear explosion yet. Atomic war is mentioned later
          in the book but seems to build on the same mistranslation of the
          Mahabharata as Von D&auml;niken, Sitchins, Pauwels, and Bergier
          use.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Another author named Peter Kolosimo, or Pier Domenico Colosimo as his
          real name was, published 1974 a book called "Timeless Earth." In it,
          we find one of the earliest mentions of a futuristic weapon being the
          reason for the inhalation and doom of the city. Colosimo claims that
          no graves have been found in the city of Mohenjo Daro, and why it was
          abandoned is unclear. Colosimo speculates that a likely explanation
          for there not being a single dead body is due to a weapon that
          "atomized" the inhabitants. Due to the weapon's power, nothing was
          left at the end of the attack on those who once lived there.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a later book called "Doomsday 1999 A.D.," Berlitz incorporates this
          narrative regarding the site but changes the disintegration to
          something else. On page 124, it's written, "/.../ as if doom had come
          so swiftly that the inhabitants did not have time to get to their
          houses. These skeletons, after unknown thousands of years, are still
          among the most radioactive that have ever been found, on a par with
          those of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
        </p>
        <p>
          While Berlitz does not say it was an atomic bomb that had exploded,
          it's evident from the text that we are supposed to fill this idea in
          ourselves. David Hatcher Childress certainly did and incorporated it
          in his 1988 book "Lost Cities of Ancient Lemuria &amp; the Pacific."
          But note here that we have not gotten any source for the radioactive
          claim. Something that would change in 2000 when Childress released
          "Technology of the Gods." If you flip to page 238, we can find this
          little passage in a section dealing with the skeletons found at the
          site. "Soviet scholars have found a skeleton at one site that had a
          radioactive level fifty times greater than normal. The Russian
          archaeologist A. Gorbovsky mentions the high incidence of radiation
          associated with the skeletons in his 1966 book, Riddles of Ancient
          History."
        </p>
        <p>
          From this point, other authors will start to reference Russian
          scientists and Gorbovsky as a source for the radioactivity on the
          site. For example, Philip Coppens quoted Gorbovsky in a 2007 article,
          "Best evidence?." The interesting part there is while Coppens didn't
          reference Childress, Coppens added another invented source. In the
          article, Philip Coppens claims that an archaeologist named Francis
          Taylor said there are depictions in a temple of people praying to be
          spared from a green light. There is no such depiction at Mohenjo Daro,
          and I can't find any Francis Taylor who should have published anything
          on the site. I did find an archaeologist and numismatic (study of
          coin) named George Francis Taylor. George Taylor was writing about
          Lebanon's historic temples but not about Mohenjo Daro. In later
          retellings on authorless blogs, a fictional foreman, Lee Hundley,
          joins the imaginary Francis Taylor. It's nice that fictional
          archaeological digs get the funds to hire more staff.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          You might wonder how it is with the Russian archaeologist A.
          Gorbovsky. Does he exist? The answer is yes, he existed, but Gorbovsky
          is not an archaeologist. He was born in 1930 in Kyiv, then part of the
          USSR, and named Alexander Alfredovich Gorbovsky (Алекса́ндр Альфре́дович
          Горбо́вский). Alexander Gorbovsky would go on and study at the
          Lomonosov Moscow State University, getting a degree as a linguist and
          oriental historian. Most of his scientific work covers modern history
          and linguistic studies, but Gorbovsky seems to have become
          increasingly interested in pseudoscience.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So in 1966, he published his first book on this subject called
          "Zagadki drevneyshey istorii" (Загадки древнейшей истории), or if we
          would translate to English, we get "Mysteries of Ancient History."
          Zahadky can also mean riddle, puzzle, or enigma, so Childress
          translation is not wrong. But I want to stress that this book has no
          official translation into English.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the book covers a lot of the things we are familiar with, ranging
          from the lost race of giants, unexplained coincidences, world-ending
          disasters, and how Europeans spread culture in pre-colonial America.
          Reading the book, I get more Hancock vibes than Von D&auml;niken or
          Sitchin, for example. There is a similar idea to Hancock present in
          Gorbovsky, but to be fair, they are not that original and have been
          around for quite some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right, so Gorbovsky did exist; he did write on pseudoscientific
          topics. But did he then claim Mohenjo Daro was evidence of a nuclear
          attack? To find the answer to this, we need to go to the chapter
          called "Skrytyye Znaniya" (Скрытые знания) or Hidden Knowledge, and
          the first paragraph of the chapter contains this quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Other findings are known that baffle researchers. In this regard, we
          can recall a discovery in India. A human skeleton, the radioactivity
          of which is 50 times higher than normal! (See "Problems of Space
          Biology," vol. 11,
        </p>
        <p>
          page 23). For the deposits found in the skeleton to have such high
          radioactivity, this man, who died 4000 years ago, had to have eaten
          [radioactive] food for a long time, the radioactivity of which should
          be hundreds of times higher than usual!"
        </p>
        <p>
          So it turns out that Gorbovsky did not mention Mohenjo Daro at all,
          just a discovery that baffled scholars, according to the author. As
          you heard, we got a source on the radioactive skeleton. The French
          researcher Philippe Hernandez did unearth the original article
          published by Lebendinsky and Nefedov called "Problemy Radiatsionnoy
          Bezopasnosti Kosmicheskikh Poletov" (ПРОБЛЕМЫ РАДИАЦИОННОЙ
          БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ КОСМИЧЕСКИХ ПОЛЕТОВ) or in English "Problems of Radiation
          Safety in Space Flights."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the section that Gorbovsky refers to, we can read the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          "For example, in areas of Monazite sand in India containing Thorium,
          the total dose of radiation reaches 600 mrem/year. An increase in the
          natural radiation background is also observed in high-mountain
          regions, where the radiation dose can be two to three times higher
          than the dose at sea level. From this point of view,
          paleo-radiobiology data are of great interest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the recently obtained data of Mayneord, in the ribs of a
          man who lived more than 4000 years ago, the radioactivity turned out
          to be 50 times greater than in a contemporary human (3.4 .10-12 and
          6.8 .10-14 curie / g, respectively)."m
        </p>
        <p>
          So the first part deals with natural radiation, which we must deal
          with daily. It does not matter what you do; radiation is all around
          you and is just part of nature. Remember, kids, it's the dose that
          makes the poison. Thorium is compared to uranium, a relatively common
          radioactive substance in Monazite. It is A phosphate mineral that
          reminds you of sand in its color. As the authors note, this mineral
          can be found in India and the U.S., Norway, Australia, and other
          places. But the authors are dealing with the issue of increasing
          radiation due to elevation. But they manage to get what I believe is a
          mistranslation into the text.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why the scientist is discussing this is that the natural
          radiation levels increase with the elevation. So the higher up you
          are, the more radiation you will naturally get. So if you intend to
          send people into space, this is a real issue you must deal with. So
          this is the aim of the article itself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mayneord in question is William Valentine Mayneord, a British
          physician and researcher. In 1960 he published the article "Naturally
          Occurring Alpha Activity" in "The Hazards to Man of Nuclear
        </p>
        <p>
          And Allied Radiations - a Second Report to the Medical Research
          Council." Mayneord writes, "It may be of interest that we have
          obtained from the British Museum the rib of an Egyptian who died
          almost 4000 years ago. The total alpha activity is 0.34
          &micro;&micro;c/gram dried bone." So it turns out that Lebendinsky and
          Nefedov made a blunder somehow in their text, and Gorbovsky read this
          and did not, in turn, go and verify that what they said was correct.
          Instead, he added a nationality to the skeleton, something Lebendinsky
          and Nefedov didn't mention. So the highly radioactive Indian skeleton
          never did exist. It was an Egyptian with a lower alpha radiation level
          than a Londoner and Inuit.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this should be more than enough to put this whole thing to bed. The
          radioactive claims regarding Mohenjo Daro are pure fiction. We have
          not yet solved how Childress, who does not seem to speak Russian,
          learned about this. It might be, as Jason Colavito points out,
          propaganda out of Russia recycled by Hindu Nationalistic papers to
          support their agenda. Colavito has traced the claim to a copy of
          "Illustrated Weekly of India," which references another magazine
          called "The Statesman," discussing Gorbovsky's alleged find. Colavito
          also points out that the USSR propaganda magazine "Sputnik" ran an
          article in issue number 9 1986 called "Riddles of Ancient History"
          written by Gorbovsky.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jason Colavito and I have not been able to locate a copy of the issue,
          but it would be strange if this was not what Childress referenced in
          his 1988 book. Basically, meaning that Childress happily read and
          repeated USSR propaganda to sell his books. Sure, he did add some
          things by mixing them with Berlitz and Colosimo's ideas. But there we
          have it, the bare truth finally. But this shows the importance of
          really reading what you are quoting. We see this quite often in the
          pseudoscientific community. They copy each other without mentioning it
          and never really double-check that what they say is correct. While
          finding and translating sources in a different language was
          significantly harder 20 or 30 years ago, it was still possible.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now while looking into all of this and trying to work my way back to
          the origin, I did note that it's started to appear two camps regarding
          Mohenjo Daro within the alternative history crowd. Not all seem to buy
          into the official alternative history story. Nick Redfern, for
          example, points out in his 2016 book "Wepons of the gods" that "the
          biggest problem here is that there is no evidence to suggest that
          either city [Harappa and Mohenjo Daro] was destroyed." Redfern also
          points out that some of the reporting, such as the quotes from Francis
          Taylor, does not exist.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now Redfern still seems to believe that the radioactive skeletons are
          real, and while it might not have been a nuclear blast, it could have
          been a powerplant that broke. Or that the explosion was much further
          away. But toward the end of the chapter, Nick points out that there's
          no objective evidence for this to be true. In the next edition, it's
          clear that Nick can write that the whole story is false. The evidence
          never existed from the start. Feel free to quote as much as you like,
          Nick. Just remember to add the sources.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the lesson here is that we should always try to look at the
          original sources, especially for extraordinary claims. Are the source
          really saying what the author says it does? Especially on the
          Internet! There does not have to be evil intent, but scientific
          journals can be hard to understand sometimes. People make mistakes, so
          if we hear something that might be too good to be true, we should look
          up the original source. It can be things we read in the news, on
          Wikipedia, and definitely what we can read in these pseudoscientific
          texts from Childress, Berlitz, Von D&auml;niken, and all our experts
          on these shows.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2>Here be monsters</h2>
        <p>
          The rest of the episode is a mishmash of wrongly cited religious texts
          from India, Greece, Egypt, and other places. We also get more
          evolution denialism, of course, and here is the issue with the show.
          It constantly repeats itself since there's not much they can use
          without starting to fabricate too much. So while it's interesting to
          see how and what they are misquoting from these sources, we need to
          save something for later since the same things appear in later
          episodes. To be honest, we don't miss much of the latter part of the
          show. Take, for example, the discussion on Garuda, a Hindu Demigod
          that functions mainly as a mount for Vishnu. While maybe playing a
          more significant role in the Hindu religion, Garuda can also be found
          in Buddhist and Jain religious texts. But the level of the discussion
          is borderline childish. Just listen to this quote by Giorgio
          Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Garuda was considered to be a snake killer. In fact, Garuda needed to
          eat snakes in order to survive. Now compare an airplane at the airport
          today hooked up to a fuel line. Isn't that airplane eating a snake? If
          you see modern fighter jets take off in the middle of the night, and
          there's smoke and fire coming out of the exhaust, it looks like a
          dragon. It looks like some type of a mythical creature, especially if
          you don't know what you're witnessing is nuts-and-bolts technology.
          So, of course you're gonna liken it to a living creature. Those
          Ancient Aliens knew that our ancestors would worship them as gods
          because they knew that our ancestors didn't know it was technology.
          They thought it was magic, spirituality, divine intervention, which it
          never was." - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, Giorgio stated that our ancestors were not stupid, but now
          they can't describe hoes connected to an airplane? They can't
          differentiate between a living creature and an object? And would not
          the aliens maybe talk with the humans and explain things to them?
          Claiming that people who obviously had language to describe things
          could not describe things accurately is a lazy statement. But this is
          the level we have for the rest of the episode. So let's save the
          misquoting of texts for a later date and close the episode out for
          this time.&nbsp;

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.

        <p>Until next time, keep shoveling that science!</p>
