        <p>
          Welcome to <em>Digging Up Ancient Aliens</em>. This is the podcast
          where we examine alternative history and ancient alien narratives in
          popular media. Do these ideas hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?
        </p>

        <p>
          We are now on episode 74, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we will look back at two sites we
          covered in the past, but with some new information and approaches.
          Today's excursion is based on the <em>Ancient Aliens</em> episode
          "<strong>Mysterious Structures</strong>" from season eight. This is
          basically a clip show from past episodes. A bit of the issue with
          <em>Ancient Aliens</em> is that they tend to reuse material over time.
          But to add some new things, I'll discuss <em>Ancient Aliens</em>,
          Graham Hancock's latest season of <em>Ancient Apocalypse</em>, and a
          TikToker who is trying to say that Rapa Nui or Easter Island is either
          Aliens, Atlantis, or both.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the second half, we will look at the Coral Castle and if this
          modern megalithic structure could be an alien intervention. A hint:
          it's not.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to thank all of you who support the show. You are really
          helping out producing this content, and I'm humbled and grateful for
          your support. If you want to help out, I'll tell you how to do that
          and get some bonus stuff at the end of the episode.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website,
          <a href="http://diggingupancientaliens.com"
            >diggingupancientaliens.com</a
          >. There, you can also find contact info if you notice any mistakes or
          have any suggestions. And if you like the podcast, I would appreciate
          it if you left one of those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much
          about.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>

        <h2>Moai</h2>

        <p>
          So, let's return to the Moai statues. We have already visited Rapa Nui
          or Easter Island twice, but it's apparently time to return to the
          island. We first went here in
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-27-aliens-and-lost-worlds.html"
            target="_blank"
            >episode 27</a
          >, where we discussed the Moai statues. The second time was in
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-34-aliens-and-the-secret-code.html"
            target="_blank"
            >episode 34</a
          >, where the focus was more on Thor Heyerdahl's racist approach to the
          island and the 2020 Ioannidis et al. paper claiming a link between the
          Polynesian Islands and Colombia.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like a lazy sitcom, I could make this segment into a clip show, but
          let's try to avoid this. Instead, I want to grab things from
          <em>Ancient Aliens</em> that they bring up, some of the TikToker
          Jahnnah James and a bit from Graham Hancock's new series
          <em>Ancient Apocalypse</em>. So it will be a bit of a clip show with
          some new information.
        </p>

        <p>
          As we learn, this episode is one of those episodes where the writers
          have run out of ideas. There are not many new clips or information.
          What is interesting is that they do bring up a myth that's actually
          been studied from an archaeological perspective.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "According to the oral history of the Rapa Nui, the Moai were moved
            in a very unusual way."
          </p>
          <p>
            "They all reply basically the same thing. The Moai walked to the
            ahu, and that's the only explanation that they give." – Charles
            Love, Ph.D.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Right, so this is something we did, in fact, cover in episode 27.
          Lipo, Hunt, and Haoa conducted experimental archaeology in 2013 and
          demonstrated that you can move these blocks by walking them. Here, we
          have a great example of how archaeologists investigate myths and use
          them as a foundation for an experiment. They tested the idea of a
          walking Moai statue and succeeded. But this is an experiment not
          covered by the alternative history crowd, and you can ask yourself,
          why not? Here is precisely what they are asking for: Academia uses
          myths as a basis in their experiments.
        </p>

        <p>
          It so happens that Graham Hancock visits Rapa Nui in
          <em>Ancient Apocalypse</em> in the new season. While I've not watched
          it, I had to read the transcript due to a certain TikTok reference in
          the episode. What struck me was that Hancock never mentioned the
          movement of the statues or seemed to see that as a mystery. He does
          bring up that they were moved but not how. It's strange that the study
          from 2013 was not brought up because it's something Hancock is
          actively asking for. We take these myths and test them. Instead, we
          get this weird idea that the island has some sort of lost
          civilization. The Polynesians came there, and the statues were already
          in place. How he gets to that conclusion is a bit unclear, especially
          since there's no evidence of an earlier population on the island. He
          suggests it and then takes it as fact since how would one prove it?
          You can't C14 stone.
        </p>

        <p>
          What we can do here is to look at the archaeological record. What
          traces can we find of human activity? It can be trash, agriculture,
          slaughter, burials, fireplaces, and the list can go on and on. Of
          course, we have found evidence of human activity on Rapa Nui (or
          Easter Island), but it did not really start until 1200 CE. While some
          radiocarbon dates have shown older dates, they have been problematic.
          Terry Hunt does discuss in the <em>Scientific American</em> that the
          most likely date for people arriving on the island is around 1200 CE.
          While he does humor the idea of an earlier population, he notes that
          it would have been so small that it would not appear in the
          archaeological record. So, would this small group be able to erect all
          those statues without leaving a single trace? Well, as we discussed in
          the episode of the Kensington Runestone, people do leave traces,
          especially if we have to build or occupy an area for a longer time.
        </p>

        <p>
          But that's kind of the thing here. The Hancocks and the Ancient Alien
          proponents of the world are not here to offer answers but to sell you
          a mystery. It then gets even worse when we go out on TikTok, where the
          source criticism of <em>Ancient Aliens</em> seems to be a paragon of
          light in comparison. You should be lucky if you are unaware of the
          "comedian" Jahanna James. This is not a person new to the show or my
          social media; I've done some videos debunking her claims in the past.
          However, she is a presence on TikTok and has been involved with the
          Cosmic Summit and similar events in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
          Quite recently she did put out a video discussing Rapa Nui, she even
          went there to investigate the Moai statues herself! If you find
          <em>Ancient Aliens</em>' use of sources frustrating, things do not
          become better on TikTok. In this video on Rapa Nui, James claims to
          have read multiple articles and gives us this quote.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "This is the carbon dating evidence of human presence and its age.
            And there is a piece of evidence for human presence. 2400 years old.
            And I could not see in the paper what that was referring to. But
            it's there."
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          On the screen we see graphs showing the amount of samples and how old
          they are. The paper is never mentioned, nor is it listed in any sort
          of sources provided by James. In the graph, we see that there is one
          sample that is 2400 years old. The issue is that the graph is meant to
          show the number of samples taken and the number of reliable samples.
          Parts of a few bars are in a different color to show samples that were
          not contaminated or otherwise problematic from a scientific
          perspective. The 2400-year-old sample was one of those that were very
          uncertain and showed an extensive range of possible dates.
        </p>

        <p>
          We should note, though, that this was not a paper but an article from
          the <em>American Scientist</em>. If you are curious, the article in
          question is called "<a
            href="https://www.americanscientist.org/article/rethinking-the-fall-of-easter-island"
            >Rethinking the Fall of Easter Island</a
          >," written by Terry Hunt. So, if we read the article, we learn that
          the samples taken in situ and in good condition are more or less 900
          years old, indicating that the settlement started around 1200 CE.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hancock and others have objected to this relatively late settlement
          date. To show that it's possible that people have been on Rapa Nui for
          longer, Hancock in <em>Ancient Apocalypse</em> talked with Sonia Hoa
          Cardinale. In episode three, Hoa Cardinale talks about a banana seed
          with a 3000 BP C-14 date. A bit of a red flag is that this seed and
          date are not yet published. If Hoa Cardinale gets the data out there,
          it might be an exciting find that might correlate with the settlement
          process of Vanuatu. In 2020, a team could, based on dental calculus,
          show that bananas made it to the island around 2900 BP. From the
          information we have, there is a case to be made to have a bit of
          caution regarding the claim.
        </p>

        <p>
          But it's interesting to see how these competing ideas regarding Aliens
          vs. Lost Civilization use a site and different narratives in their
          cover of a site. They can rely on the same myths or stories, but one
          gets Atlantis, and the other gets Aliens.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's shift over to the USA and a site that's not really ancient at
          all.
        </p>

        <h2>Coral Castle</h2>

        <p>
          Welcome back. We moved quite a bit from Easter Island to Florida
          during the 1900s. We're here to visit the Coral Castle, one of the few
          modern megalithic sites built. It's a place loved by ancient alien
          believers, conspiracy theorists, and alternative energy people. The
          backstory for the place goes something like this:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "He was in love with a woman, and he wanted to build this facility
            in memory of her. And he waited for her to come from Europe, and he
            waited and he waited, and she never did. But the big question is, is
            how did this frail little man move these thousands of pounds of
            block by himself." – George Noory.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          If you are not familiar with this site, it's a park built by Edward
          Leedskalnin. Construction started in 1928 and continued until
          Leedskalnin died in 1951. While the place is known as the Coral
          Castle, it's not a castle, and the coral is, in reality, local oolite
          limestone. Leedskalnin started the project as a tribute to his
          16-year-old fiancée, who broke off the engagement a day before the
          wedding. Edward, originally from Latvia, decided to move to the US.
        </p>

        <p>
          But how could this man alone construct this park? Something often left
          out of the discussion is that Leedskalnin came from a family of
          stonemasons. He was even trained as a mason who specialized in
          gravestones. Oolite limestone is quite a porous and soft stone that
          can easily be quarried and worked with simple tools. So, when it comes
          to the quarry and masonry at Coral Castle, there is no need for aliens
          or specialized tools. It can simply be explained by Leedskalnin's
          training and expertise on rocks. In addition to this, he worked in
          lumber camps and cattle drives, and he was no frail man. He was used
          to hard work and figuring things out as he went. There are also claims
          that Ed didn't use tools, but a wide assortment of masonry tools are
          today on display in his old toolshed.
        </p>

        <p>
          People often focus on how this man could move the blocks in this
          alternative history. Here, the answer is that, for the most part, he
          seems to have used block and tackle, something we can see in images of
          him using these tools. The methods used by Wally Wallington, the man
          who created his own Stonehenge in his backyard, explain more. With
          simple tools, Wallington moves heavy blocks by himself. For example,
          with a simple pebble as a fulcrum, Wallington moves blocks weighing 1
          ton as if they were nothing.

          It seems likely that Leedskalnin knew of some of these tricks, too.
          For example, we can see this in one of the giant stone gates at the
          park. This massive stone slab seemed to weigh a lot, yet it was
          possible to operate it with a single finger. The mystery of the door
          was finally revealed in 1986 when it broke, revealing the slab was
          standing on a truck bearing on top of a metal shaft.

          So, if it's just a bit of ingenuity and tricks, how has the park
          become so connected with aliens and alternative technology? Well, that
          is due to Leedskalnin's ability to sell a story. As Karen Stolzno
          points out in an article on Coral Castle, when Ed was asked about how
          he moved the blocks, Ed would just say, "I have discovered the secrets
          of the pyramids." Suppose someone would suggest some mystical
          technique like "Tibetan Monk techniques," such as singing to the
          stones, using extraterrestrial help, or possessing superhuman
          strength. In that case, Ed seems to have just nodded and gone along
          with it. Another often-heard claim is that he worked alone at night
          often; this appears to have some truth to it, according to Stollznow.
          This might not be so much for secrecy but to escape the Florida sun,
          but of course, things are more complicated to see in the dark from a
          distance.

          Edward Leedskalnin also cultivated his advanced technology myth by
          publishing pamphlets on magnetism and electricity. These writings have
          been adopted by the free energy movement, for example. Most of this
          writing does not seem to contain much advanced knowledge today. It is
          primarily strange ideas about magnetism and some darker themes. Brian
          Dunning mentioned that these magnetic ramblings also contain "... a
          political rant that sounds like Hitler could have written it."
        </p>

        <p>
          The museum has continued selling this mystical story today. In an
          article for <em>LiveScience</em>, Benjamin Radford mentions that the
          museum website wrote, "Coral Castle has baffled scientists, engineers,
          and scholars since its opening in 1923." But while Coral Castle might
          be impressive, we should, if anything, appreciate it as a testament to
          human ingenuity and persistence rather than a source of unsolved
          mystery. The techniques used by Leedskalnin were not mystical or alien
          in origin; they were based on principles of physics and engineering
          that have been understood for centuries. The perpetuation of the myth
          serves more as a marketing tool than a reflection of reality. In the
          end, Coral Castle stands as a monument not to extraterrestrial
          intervention or lost ancient knowledge but to what a determined
          individual can accomplish using essential tools and hard work. It's a
          reminder that sometimes, the most extraordinary feats are achieved not
          through mysterious means but through ordinary human effort.
