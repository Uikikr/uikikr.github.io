            If aliens did visit us, what was their mission? Is the Annunaki a
            set of gods or something more sinister? Is there a hideous creature
            hidden away in Saqqara Egypt? Was Homo Erectus victims of genetic
            experiments?

            What would the Nazca Lines, elongated sculls, Akhenaten, and the
            Dogon tribe have in common? The answer seems obvious, according to
            the History Channels TV show Ancient Aliens, but what would an
            archeologist think?
