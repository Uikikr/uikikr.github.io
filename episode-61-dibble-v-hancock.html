          This is the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative
          history and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold
          water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations out
          there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 60, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. If you have missed it, Professor Flint Dibble,
          out of Cardiff University, went on the Joe Rogan Podcast to debate
          Graham Hancock. I have a vague feeling that you are perfectly aware of
          this and have most likely heard a bunch of takes already. Like my
          podcast neighbor,
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.archaeologypodcastnetwork.com/pseudo"

            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Dr. Andrew Kinkella</span> </a
          >. I can’t help that Joe Rogan scheduled this to release the same date
          as my last episode, meaning there are two weeks until my next show
          comes on. It’s almost as if this is a conspiracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But don’t turn this episode off thinking there will be nothing new
          here! Because my take might not be like the others. It might be a bit
          more critical. I’m also joined by Professor Howard Williams, also
          known as Archaeodeath, on
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@archaeodeath">
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">TikTok</span>
          </a>
          and
          <a
            target="_blank"

          >
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">YouTube</span> </a
          >. Or rather, I joined him on a live talk when this was just
          released.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the first section of the episode will involve me reflecting a bit
          on some time after. Then, Professor Williams will join me in the
          second part. If you want the full raw chat with Williams, you should
          sign up on Patreon or the members portal. Just as a few lovely
          supporters already have done, something I’m extremely grateful for.
          So, with those people buttered, I guess there’s nothing more than to
          remind you that sources can be found on diggingupancientaliens.com
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let’s dig into the
          episode.

          about what I bring up here. That's not often I say in this show, but I
          genuinely wish I'm shown to be incorrect. I also admit that I'm not

          to listen to these long shows where the host doesn't know what they
          are talking about. I understand that the show's selling point is that
          Rogan is just an average bloke, a regular Joe, one might say,

          is not like everyone else. Rogan operates one of the

          YouTube. These are not the numbers of the average Joe. As we will see,
          these numbers should put some journalistic pressure on Joe Rogan,
          something he doesn't take upon himself. That unwillingness to do

        <p>
          With this large platform in mind, it's not strange that Dibble or any
          other historian or archaeologist would like to use this to spread good
          information. The setting we got, however, was that science-based
          archaeology and

          are equal. For it to be a debate, there need to be two sides whose
          ideas are, to some extent, equal.

          merely a competing opinion."&nbsp;

          Dibble also discusses Bill Nye's debate with Ken Ham and how some
          experts referred to it as a mistake. But in reality, it was a way to
          make information accessible for younger generations, and now the

          </a>
          is above 50% among the US population. I'd like to point out that the
          debate is a bit of a double-edged sword. The acceptance of evolution
          has been on the rise since before. Sure, it peaked in 2014, but it is
          worth mentioning that this belief has been in decline since then.
          Suffolk University, in the
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/research-at-suffolk/political-research-center/polls/national/2023"
          >
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">most recent poll</span>
          </a>
          on the subject from 2023, shows that 53% of those questioned believe
          in some version of evolution. 37% do not believe in evolution at all.
          So, it seems as if we are barely holding onto the lead.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the backside of the debate, it helped Ken Ham restart his
          funding campaign for the Ark Encounter. With the media attention,
          donations started to come in, and the park could open in 2016. Since
          then, it's been costing Kentucky taxpayers large sums of money in
          different incentives, and the park has tried to re-register as a
          non-profit religious entity. The park is open for schools to visit,
          and tours are offered to children. While the Ark Encounter might not
          be the financial and attendee success Ham had hoped for, it's still a
          place that promotes Young Earth Creationism. So, while there was an
          initial benefit, the aftermath down the road is more murky. It will be
          hard to say what and if there will be any upsides or downsides from
          Dibble's debate with Hancock a decade down the road.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With this said, I'm not claiming we should not engage with believers
          in pseudo-sciences. Not at all. Editor of the Skeptic and several
          times skeptic of the year,

          control. Marshall does a great job navigating this discussion and
          knows when and how to push these promoters of false scientific claims.
          A skill that was lacking from Rogan in Dibble's debate with Hancock.
          Joe Rogan can't host a conversation on complex topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is clear in other episodes with Rogan, who tends to have on
          personalities promoting false and dangerous ideas. These include Milo
          Yiannopoulos, Alex Jones, Gavin McInnes, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Graham
          Hancock,
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-41-atlantis-reloaded-corsetti.html"

            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Jimmy Corsetti</span> </a
          >, and Charles C. Johnson. Rogan has repeatedly failed to push back
          against what these people said. Monica Hesse, in the Washington Post,
          wrote about how Joe Rogan failed to push back against Charles C.
          Johnson's claims that black people were more prone to violence. Joe
          Rogan also struggles with fact-checking guests' claims while live and
          mostly Googles the keywords the guests give him, or rather Rogan's
          assistant. This resulted in Robert F. Kennedy convincing Joe that what
          he said about vaccines being dangerous is true. Because Rogan's
          assistant didn't realize they were on a webpage made by Kennedy.
          Monica Hesse describes the scenario very well in her column in the<a

            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)"> Washington Post</span> </a
          >: "He's not nimble enough or forethinking enough to engage in
          intellectual battle with guests who are not there to seek truth but to
          recruit converts."
        </p>
        <p>
          Something visible in the Dibble and Hancock debate was that Rogan
          often felt inept in asking piercing questions, especially toward
          Graham Hancock. While some claim that Rogan seemed more convinced by
          Dibble toward the end, I'm unsure if I agree. Becoming warmer as they
          got to know each other, maybe. But I can't claim to know what happens
          in Rogan's head. The conspiracy-prone guest also affects those who
          listen to Joe.

          >, it's a majority of white conservative males. They are more prone to
          not trusting vaccines or the media. While Dibble knows he won't
          convert the hardcore fans, it's still an uphill battle with Rogan's
          audience in mind. While one study has shown that a fact sandwich might
          help convince some people regarding claims in a political debate, I'm
          not sure how effective it is in this setting. When it comes to this
          audience, we might need a different approach.

          </a>
          that we need to get these people to ask themselves, "What evidence
          would it take to change my mind?" From there, they can embark on a
          journey and apply skeptical thinking.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not sure how many who changed their minds in the Dibble v Hancock
          debate. That's the dirty little secret with debates we try to ignore;
          we go into them with our minds made up and leave most often the same.
          I've seen posts on Twitter and Facebook that there are threads on
          Hancock's subreddit that fans don't think he won. As one in several
          Reddits and telegram places, I've not seen that as much. I went to
          Hancock's Reddit and found some posts claiming Dibble won, but those
          comments seemed to be from accounts posting skeptical comments. For
          the most part, inside these alternative history forums where Hancock,
          while tired, showed those academics in their ivory tower, Hancock
          can't be silenced, and they can't answer his questions. That's also a
          common outcome; your favorite always wins the debate. Everyone is a
          winner.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Joe Rogan has an enormous platform, but will it really benefit us
          going there? Is it worth it for us to sit down with a transphobe with
          a history of racist remarks? I have to acknowledge that we have those
          among us science educators and even archaeology and history educators
          who have made transphobic remarks. We should definitely deal with
          that, but striving to be on Rogan won't help us as much as we
          think.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It kind of downplays our impact even without Netflix specials and
          Rogan. We have brilliant creators and people out there who make
          amazing educational content. Milo from

          with several millions of views. All of that without promoting bigots
          or pseudo-scientists. We should be proud of this and see our value.
          Instead of driving traffic to the Rogans and Hancocks of the world,
          let's drive traffic to a place where it would matter. Let's start a
          stipend that can help educators improve their production value. Get
          funds to pitch good history shows to the production companies. I think
          somewhere here is the best way forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we engage with these people, as we should, we should do so in a
          setting where we are in control. And we need to see our value, even
          without Joe Rogan.
