          The short answer is yes, Rome both the culture and city is real. But
          if you happen to have been following a dark section of TikTok you
          might have been led to believe differently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This little piece is not really to debunk or disprove this. Others
          have been doing that already quite successfully. I would recommend
          Cinzia Dubois (known as lady of the library) and Sara Heed
          (Archeological fantasies) rebuttal if you are more interested in that.
          There&rsquo;s more but these two don&rsquo;t use the TikTokers name or
          handle and to be honest. This individual doesn't need more attention.
          We&rsquo;re not hiding anything, but the idea is just ludicrous.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what&rsquo;s all this really about? So a person on TikTok started
          to make videos claiming that Ancient Rome never existed. Rome is just
          the imagination of the Spanish Inquisition (or just inquisition,
          I&rsquo;m not sure why we need to whitewash the inquisition but that
          would be another subject), to further the Catholic Church. Everything
          that we assume to be Roman is in reality just Greek.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The TikToker claim that the Latin language was not invented until 1500
          by monks and nuns. They claim for some reason that there are no
          primary sources for Latin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allt the Roman emperors were Greek who spoke Greek. Therefore all
          architecture and culture is Greek, not Roman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore Rome was the ancient version of Disney world. It was a
          circus where you had fun and ate bread.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 CE was faked and Pompei was
          created by victorians much later.
        </p>
        <p>
          It doesn&rsquo;t take a lot of thought and effort to realize that this
          is just bunk. But again why am I talking about this? Well mostly
          because this person is using basically the same methods as the Ancient
          Alienists. The TikToker is using low resolution images, images without
          a source or worse a reconstruction that they claim is the
          original.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have dropping studies that in reality doesn&rsquo;t prove their
          argument. We have misinterpreted ancient texts and claimes that Latin
          texts are written in fenician but with backwards letters.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But you might say &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the harm? People can&rsquo;t
          really believe these things&rdquo;. Well, before I got blocked (the
          user blocks anyone who asks tough questions) the user had something
          like 90 000+ followers. Sure it&rsquo;s not a huge amount of numbers
          but there&rsquo;s 90 000+ people who are getting misinformed. Both in
          what would constitute as a good piece of evidence and how it&rsquo;s
          best communicated, but also a bad understanding on how science works
          and operates.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the point of writing we&rsquo;ve done two episodes of Ancient
          Aliens. The show makes many of these errors. My hope is to arm you
          against claims presented in this way and provide resources and
          knowledge that makes it easier if you encounter them in the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s put an end to pseudoscience and alternative history.
          Let&rsquo;s keep an open mind, but the brain should not be able to
          fall out. Let&rsquo;s do science, learn and grow together.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&rsquo;s all, thank you for listening. Keep your Occam's razors
          sharp and true.
