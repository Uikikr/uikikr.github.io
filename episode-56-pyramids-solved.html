          How were the great pyramids of Giza built? This is a question that's
          been asked for a long time. The answers have been ranging from those
          based on the best available evidence to the more far-out ideas. Among
          those, there are suggestions that such precision and scale could only
          be the work of extraterrestrial intervention. But what do the most
          recent archaeological discoveries and scientific experiments tell us?
        </p>
        <p>
          This time we delve into the true ingenuity behind these monumental
          structures. The pseudo-historical narratives often propose that the
          pyramids' advanced engineering and astronomical alignments are beyond
          human capability. Yet, a closer examination of historical records,
          architectural techniques, and archaeological findings reveals a
          different story.

          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in
          popular media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 56, and I am Fredrik. Together, we will fence
          the misinformation with some trowels while dancing on the Ockhams
          Razors' edge. Today we will start to talk about the last of the Seven
          Wonders that still stands. ´The breathtaking pyramids of ancient Egypt
          standing at the Giza Plateau. These structures have inspired and
          raised questions through the millennials. Of course, this has led to
          some wild theories and speculations. Many of wich we will be able to
          put to rest today, including the Orion connection, leveling the site,
          and several ramp theories.
        </p>

          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let’s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we stand on the Giza plateau in Egypt. In front of us, we
          have a large complex of pyramids and temples. The most famous of these
          are the pyramids of Menkaure, Kahfre, and the Great Pyramid of Khufu.
          We will spend most of our time with the Horizon of Khufu, as the
          pyramid was called. But we should not forget Menkaure and Kahfre,
          especially since Kahfre's pyramid is only 10 meters or 33 feet shorter
          than grandfather Kufu's pyramid. So how is the pyramid complex in Giza
          presented in Ancient Aliens?
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The massive structures are engineered to near perfection and are
            believed by many to have been intentionally placed to align with the
            three belt stars of the Orion constellation. But of greatest
            significance to ancient astronaut theorists is the largest of the
            three: the Great Pyramid. This enormous structure stands 480 feet
            tall and was built from more than 2 million limestone blocks, each
            weighing thousands of pounds</em
          >."
        </p>
        <h2 id="oct">The Orion Constellation Theory</h2>
        <p>
          So, first of all, I want to address the Orion constellation theory.
          This is far from a new idea and something we have discussed several
          times throughout the episodes. This idea was presented in the book
          Messages of The Sphinx. It was written by Graham Hancock and Robert
          Bauval and published in 1996. They present several ideas in it, one of
          which is that the pyramids we see on the Giza plateau line up
          perfectly with the Orion's belt constellation. A massive flaw in this
          idea is that it simply doesn't. The only way to get it to line up is
          to invert the picture and rearrange the pyramids to line with stars in
          Orion's belt constellation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that Hancock and Bauval simply leave out of their book. That
          the pyramids look like the Orion's belt constellation isn't really
          that Orion's belt has specific significance in Egyptian thought. It's
          more of a way to achieve our optical illusion. When Menkare built his
          pyramid, the 3rd one in the series, he seemed not to have Khufu and
          Kahfre's budget. But by placing his pyramid where he did, he could
          achieve an optical illusion visible when you approach the plateau by
          water. So, when traveling on the Nile and approaching the plateau, it
          will look like the three pyramids are all the same size at one point.
          So, this is more or less why the pyramids are set up as they are.
          Sure, this explanation isn't maybe as fancy and involves as many
          extraterrestrial aliens as Graham Hancock and Robert Bauval's idea.
          But it's grounded in reality.
        </p>
        <h2>Construction Insights</h2>
        <p>
          And then we have these two million block numbers. And it bothers me a
          bit because, as Egyptologist Nils Billing puts it. It is based on pure
          speculation. It's an estimation that relies heavily on the fact that
          there's no filling in the pyramid. And that it was constructed on a
          totally smooth surface. But if we could look at the pyramid from a
          dissected view, we will see that part of the bedrock was left. So, in
          the center of the pyramid, we have a hill. This way, they would not
          need as many stones. From further scans of the pyramids, there's a
          good amount of evidence of hollow areas filled with sand and rubble.
          So this is another way to save on the number of stone blocks needed to
          construct the pyramid. So you can take that with a grain of salt when
          you hear this 2.3 million number or whatever amount of blocks is
          claimed to have been used during construction.
        </p>
        <h2 id="materials">Materials and Methods</h2>
        <p>
          But before I get ahead of myself. Let's maybe start with the initial
          part of the pyramid construction. Alternative history proponents often
          claim that the pyramid's foundation is more level than the buildings
          today.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Great Pyramid of Giza covers 13 acres. The precision of this
            building, uh, exceeds anything that we require of builders today.
            For instance, the area of the 13 acres was leveled within
            seven-eighths of an inch. That's about the thickness of a thumbnail.
            But that's not all. The casing stones are filled with some kind of
            mysterious cement that nobody's been able to figure out what the
            formula is. This is not the work of primitive people</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the issues with Chris Dunn's claim here is that his measurement
          simply isn't correct. The average deviation in the foundation of the
          Great Pyramid of Giza is about 2 centimeters +/-. Or half an inch if
          we use the American system of measuring distance. Archeologist Craig
          Smith did point out in his book "How the Great Pyramid was built" that
          "modern leveling achieves high-end accuracy about 0.3 centimeters and
          an average accuracy of three centimeters. The ancient Egyptians did
          very well, given the limited tools."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how did the ancient Egyptians achieve this level of accurate
          leveling? Egyptologist dr Edward suggested in his book "The Pyramids
          of Egypt" that: "To level an area like the bed of a pyramid it would
          have been necessary to surround it on all four sides with low banks of
          Nile mud, fill the enclosure so formed with water, and cut a network
          of trenches in the rock in such a manner that the floor of each trench
          lay at the same depth beneath the surface of the water; the
          intervening spaces could have been leveled after the water had been
          released." Edwards's suggestion might work in locations such as Meidum
          or Dahshur. Locations that have a more flat surface from the start.
          The issue was that the Giza Plateau, especially the Pyramids of Khufu
          and Khafre, were built on a sloping plateau area. So, for example, in
          the Khafres pyramid, the builders had to cut down the northwest corner
          of the pyramid by 10 meters or 33 feet. On top of this, they actually
          had to build up the southeast corner, as Mark Lehrer points out. Mark
          Leher also mentions in his book "The Complete Pyramids" that: "Any
          levelling technique using water must take into account the problem
          that water lifting and transport in the Old Kingdom was probably
          limited to pots slung from shoulder poles. Even if all this water had
          been carried up to the plateau, it would more than likely have
          evaporated or drained away before any measurements could be completed.
          Such practical hurdles make all theories using water unworkable."
        </p>
        <p>
          After the break, if water might not been used at the Giza plateau,
          what other technique could have been used? And is the secret cement
          one of the keys to unlock the age of the pyramid?
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome back! A more realistic way to achieve this great level is to
          use a reference line. Archeologists and Egyptologists have found rows
          of holes around Khafre's and Khufu's Pyramid. These holes are
          regularly spaced about five and a half meters apart. This could be
          evidence of a very linear goofer living in the area. However,
          archaeologists have suggested a more realistic explanation for these
          postholes. And they have to do with leveling the pyramid. The Pyramid
          must rest on solid bedrock, as we learned in previous pyramid-building
          exercises. This doesn't require the bedrock itself to be level. We
          need just the foundation platform to be leveled. So what we can do is
          put posts in these holes. Then, they set a string between the poles,
          and with the string, they could make sure that the blocks of the
          foundation platform were at the same height. With this method, we can
          save quite a lot of time since we only need the outer parts of the
          foundation platform of the pyramids to be leveled. Remember, a massif
          of rock was deliberately left at the pyramid center. This was done to
          save time and effort during the construction process.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          And how to get the precise angles that the pyramid builders achieved
          can be done with at least three methods. You can use a set square, an
          A-shaped square placed on an established line on the pyramid, and then
          you can utilize this carpenter square to take out the right angle. Or
          we can use a 3-4-5 triangle or the Pythagorean triangle. We can draw
          this on the ground and use that as our reference for this right angle.
          The third option is to use intersecting arcs. While some Egyptologists
          are skeptical about this method being employed in constructing Khufu's
          pyramid. It would explain several of these postholes that we find
          around the pyramid. In the corner of the pyramid, we see two post
          holes that are a little bit outside the reference line. And they
          seemed to have been used to establish the lines for the side of the
          pyramid.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in a sense, Christopher Dunn is correct in his statement that this
          was not the work of primitive people. The ancient Egyptians were far
          from primitive. This is a label often used by the ancient alien
          people, as we have seen in previous episodes. As soon as you hear this
          primitive person, you should be careful because people trained in
          archaeology or history do not use these terms due to these negative
          connotations. Primitive people are what quantum mechanics is to
          physicists, but for archeology. It's used by people trying to sell you
          pseudo-scientific ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          So now I will let you in on our little secret here. I'll tell you the
          ingredients of that secret mortar that hasn't been replicated; wait
          for it. Limestone, gypsum, and ash. This isn't a new discovery but has
          been around for some time. We have even found where they created the
          mortar at the site. Thanks to the mortar containing organic material,
          we can even date the pyramid using C14. And guess what? The tests
          confirm a date corresponding with the reign of Khufu. So maybe it's
          not so much a secret and more that Dunn doesn't want to talk about it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ramp">Ramp Theories and Labor Techniques</h2>
        <p>
          So, let's continue to another statement that we often hear when
          alternative historians talk about the pyramids in Giza.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "And there are shafts, tunnels, and the architecture, and the way it
          was built is a mystery till today."
        </p>
        <p>
          And there are different variations of this. It's a mystery; we don't
          exactly know how they did it. Or something in this spirit. And
          sometimes I think scientists are maybe a little too careful when
          speaking about things. Because while it's kind of true that we do not
          know something with 100% certainty, we significantly understand the
          construction. While we don't have the answer to a few things, like
          what type of ramp they use, this does invalidate all the other
          evidence.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several ideas on how it could have been done, all more
          likely than levitation devices and aliens. It could have been the
          outside or inside ramp, even if Jean Pierre Houidin's inside ramp
          theory isn't looking that promising today. But there's ample evidence
          of a ramp being used. For example, the quarry for the great pyramids
          at the Giza Plateau wasn't found until 1920. The quarry was filled
          with millions of cubic meters of limestone chips, gypsum, sand, clay,
          etc. Flinders Petri missed this completely, and it took Selim Hassan a
          decade to clear out the quarry partially. But after Hassan had cleared
          parts of the quarry, the remains of a construction ramp became
          visible. The rubble cleared out was most likely the material used when
          constructing the ramp.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common objection towards an outer ramp theory is that the critics
          claim that an outer ramp would cloak the rise and angle of the
          pyramid. Making it hard for the architects and project managers to
          keep the pyramid at an accurate angle and level surface. While this
          initially sounds like sound criticism, it doesn't really account for
          the evidence and archaeological remains that we have. This objection
          relies heavily on the fact that the casing stones were added later and
          at a finished state.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As it turns out, the casing stones were put in much earlier. The
          blocks were only dressed in the bottom. But at the pyramid, they were
          lined up at their location with their neighbors, and then the blocks
          were dressed to fit together. They then marked how much of the access
          block on the outside was going to be shaved off at a later time. How
          much to remove was measured with a plumbline and a set square.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          After the break, we will ramp up the ramp theory and see how an
          unfinished pyramid might help us figure this out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome back. The removal of the extra stock I mentioned on the casing
          stones is clearly visible in Menkaure's pyramid. Since Menkaure died
          before the pyramid was finished, the project was abandoned. Due to
          this, the casing stones on one side were left undressed. So, we can
          really see how they got these smooth-sloping outer surfaces on the
          pyramid. And what's really interesting is that we have the markings of
          the stone masons on the undressed stones. Menkaure's pyramid is, in
          this sense, a bit more interesting because we have a treasure trove of
          markings left by the masons, the architects, and the surveys. We even
          have a painted red vertical line that marks the center axis of the
          pyramid. But by leaving these outer casing stones undressed, the
          pyramid's angle and level would be cloaked and obscured by these
          protruding stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this method would mean that, while the workers dismantled the
          ramp, they would simultaneously dress down and shave away the excess
          stone. Stopping when they hit the markings, they left earlier. In this
          way, they could achieve this smooth surface we see on the pyramids.
          They could also smooth out any uneven joints while dressing down this
          ramp.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In this ramp discussion, I also want to point out that we're mainly
          talking about the Khufu and Khafres pyramids. The smaller pyramids
          most likely used a single ramp. And in several locations, we even have
          in situ ramps. One example would be Sinki's pyramid in Abydos, a small
          step pyramid still with the ramp for the pyramid in situ against one
          of its facades. An interesting theory I've seen is that the southern
          burial could have filled an additional function besides being a ritual
          burial. Some evidence could indicate that these southern pyramids
          could have been used as part of the ramp's foundation in the more
          giant pyramids. This is particularly visible in Sneferu's bent
          pyramid, where the track seems to lead through the southern pyramid.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while we might not know exactly what ramp they used, it doesn't
          matter in this case because we have all these surrounding evidence
          pointing to a ramp being used. As we will see later on, the causeway
          from the valley Temple up to the pyramid seems to have functioned as a
          ramp when unloading blocks arriving by boat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another objection against the ancient Egyptians building the pyramids
          is often the idea that there are no tools found around the pyramids.
          Or that the tools the ancient Egyptians would have had access to could
          not have cut the stones. So, let's dismantle this idea. While there's
          no metric ton of the tools found at the site, some have been uncovered
          during excavations. We have plenty of copper tools, including chisels,
          needles, weaving points, etc. A reason why we don't find that many
          copper tools could be due to copper being monopolized by the ruling
          class. We have records demonstrating this during the Middle and New
          Kingdom. Records show that tools were assigned to workers and weighed
          and measured at the beginning and end of the day. Based on documents
          found in Wadi El-Jarf could indicate a similar practice during the Old
          Kingdom. We will return to these documents shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In previous episodes, I have talked a bit about the idea that copper
          can't cut stone. A devastating blow toward this claim is the
          experiments done by experimental archaeologist Deny Stocks; copper
          tools can be used very well to shape even hard rocks like granite. A
          common objection is that the copper chisels would become dull too
          quickly. As things turn out, this is not necessarily true. A French
          masonry worker named Mickael Restoin developed a technique to keep the
          copper chisel sharp as they chiseled the granite. Another nail in this
          coffin is the copper residue found in cut marks on stones, confirming
          that copper was used, as Mark Leher points out.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Stocks and archeologist Stella Nair have also shown that Flint tools
          can be utilized as chisels with good results. This indicates that the
          ancient Egyptians could have relied on several different resources for
          their tools to build the pyramids. Many ancient astronaut theorists
          focused on the granite within the pyramids. It is worth remembering
          that the vast majority of the stone blocks are limestone, quarried
          just beside the pyramids. Limestone is much easier to work with than
          granite. Most of the time, they would not need copper saws to achieve
          the smooth surfaces. As for the parts made out of granite, Denis
          Stocks points out that a relatively small team of skilled workers
          would be able to complete these details.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining a blunt copper blade with an abrasive such as sand gives you
          a saw capable of cutting 4 cubic centimeters of rose granite per hour.
          Experiments with copper and sand from Aswan produced a cutting rate of
          12 cubic centimeters per hour. Copper tube drills are not as effective
          but have a cutting rate of 1.5 cubic centimeters of rose granite per
          hour. So we could have several teams of three to operate the drills
          and the saws. Two are cutting and drilling; one adds the abrasive and
          maybe some liquid. However, the granite in Khufu's pyramid is chiefly
          used as material for the chambers. These blocks would not need this
          kind of work to be smooth. Chisels, pounders, and using stone to
          smooth out the surface would be much quicker and more efficient. The
          pyramids' limestone would not require this amount of precision to be
          fitted in place.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The ancient astronaut theory is dead and gone by this information
          alone. But we will seal this coffin completely next time by
          investigating the Red Sea Scrolls and deconstructing Chris Dunn's
          pyramid machine theory.&nbsp;
