        <p>
          In this little bonus episode, we'll listen to a reading of Ambrose
          Bierce's short story "The Difficulty of Crossing a Field." It's about
          a mysterious disappearance, so it might fit well with the month we're
          in now. Also, according to Ancient Aliens proponents, this work is one
          of the best examples of alien abduction in American literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          So pull up a chair, get cozy, and we will have Dizzy tell us a story.
          Then we will attempt a small literary analysis of Ambrose Bierce.
        </p>

          The outro music is written and performed by a

          Hello, I didn't see you there; v&auml;lkommen to Digging up Ancient
          Aliens. My name is Fredrik, and I'm your host for this bonus episode
          and the other ones so far. Usually, we examine the TV show, Ancient
          Aliens from an archeological perspective with the help of critical
          thinking and skepticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          In episode 22, we encountered a short story by Ambrose Bierce that the
          show was a great example of alien abduction. Let's sit down for a
          moment and listen to it. So make yourself comfortable, and we'll let
          Dizzi bring us back in time.

        <h3>The Difficulty of Crossing a Field by Ambrose Bierce</h3>
        <p>
          One morning in July, 1854, a planter named Williamson, living six
          miles from Selma , Alabama , was sitting with his wife and a child on
          the veranda of his dwelling.&nbsp; Immediately in front of the house
          was a lawn, perhaps fifty yards in extent between the house and public
          road, or, as it was called, the &ldquo;pike.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beyond this
          road lay a close-cropped pasture of some ten acres, level and without
          a tree, rock, or any natural or artificial object on its
          surface.&nbsp; At the time there was not even a domestic animal in the
          field.&nbsp; In another field, beyond the pasture, a dozen slaves were
          at work under an overseer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throwing away the stump of a cigar, the planter rose, saying: &ldquo;I
          forgot to tell Andrew about those horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Andrew was the
          overseer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Williamson strolled leisurely down the gravel walk, plucking a flower
          as he went, passed across the road and into the pasture, pausing a
          moment as he closed the gate leading into it, to greet a passing
          neighbor, Armour Wren, who lived on an adjoining plantation.&nbsp; Mr.
          Wren was in an open carriage with his son James, a lad of
          thirteen.&nbsp; When he had driven some two hundred yards from the
          point of meeting, Mr. Wren said to his son: &ldquo;I forgot to tell
          Mr. Williamson about those horses.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Wren had sold to Mr. Williamson some horses, which were to have
          been sent for that day, but for some reason not now remembered it
          would be inconvenient to deliver them until the morrow.&nbsp; The
          coachman was directed to drive back, and as the vehicle turned
          Williamson was seen by all three, walking leisurely across the
          pasture.&nbsp; At that moment one of the coach horses stumbled and
          came near falling.&nbsp; It had no more than fairly recovered itself
          when James Wren cried: &ldquo;Why, father, what has become of Mr.
          Williamson?&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>It is not the purpose of this narrative to answer that question.</p>
        <p>
          Mr. Wren&rsquo;s strange account of the matter, given under oath in
          the course of legal proceedings relating to the Williamson estate,
          here follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;My son&rsquo;s exclamation caused me to look toward the spot
          where I had seen the deceased an instant before, but he was not there,
          nor was he anywhere visible.&nbsp; I cannot say that at the moment I
          was greatly startled, or realized the gravity of the occurrence,
          though I thought it singular.&nbsp; My son, however, was greatly
          astonished and kept repeating his question in different forms until we
          arrived at the gate.&nbsp; My black boy Sam was similarly affected,
          even in a greater degree, but I reckon more by my son&rsquo;s manner
          than by anything he had himself observed (This sentence in the
          testimony was stricken out).&nbsp; As we got out of the carriage at
          the gate of the field, and while Sam was hanging the team to the
          fence, Mrs. Williamson, with her child in her arms and followed by
          several servants, came running down the walk in great excitement,
          crying: &lsquo;He is gone, he is gone!&nbsp; O God! what an awful
          thing!&rsquo; and many other such exclamations, which I do not
          distinctly recollect.&nbsp; I got from them the impression that they
          related to something more - than the mere disappearance of her
          husband, even if that had occurred before her eyes.&nbsp; Her manner
          was wild, but not more so, I think, than was natural under the
          circumstances.&nbsp; I have no reason to think she had at that time
          lost her mind.&nbsp; I have never since seen nor heard of Mr.
          Williamson.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          This testimony, as might have been expected, was corroborated in
          almost every particular by the only other eye-witness (if that is a
          proper term) - the lad James.&nbsp; Mrs. Williamson had lost her
          reason and the servants were, of course, not competent to
          testify.&nbsp; The boy James Wren had declared at first that he saw
          the disappearance, but there is nothing of this in his testimony given
          in court.&nbsp; None of the field hands working in the field to which
          Williamson was going had seen him at all, and the most rigorous search
          of the entire plantation and adjoining country failed to supply a
          clew.&nbsp; The most monstrous and grotesque fictions, originating
          with the African American, were current in that part of the State for
          many years, and probably are to this day; but what has been here
          related is all that is certainly known of the matter.&nbsp; The courts
          decided that Williamson was dead, and his estate was distributed
          according to law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, a couple of things are going on in the story. But it differs from
          what was told to us in the Ancient Alien program&mdash;no strange
          circles or voices coming from the beyond.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at it closer, we start to see that it might be about different
          experiences of a singular event. While some looked away and didn't see
          anything, others saw different things and had different ideas about
          what had happened. It's as if Ambrose is trying to explore the
          fallibility of memory and how unreliable our understanding of our
          surroundings can be.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it can be good to highlight how Ambrose Bierce pictured the
          African Americans in the story as easily spooked and spreading
          grotesque superstition.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambrose Bierce has, in other stories, tried to explore different
          viewpoints. Take, for example, the short story "Chickamauga," in which
          we explore a battlefield from a six-year-old child's perspective. The
          age makes it more complicated for the child to comprehend the horrors.
          To render the child more of an outsider, he is also deaf. It is an
          exciting exploration Bierce sets us in during the story.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          He is also exploring fleeting perspectives of characters in "The Death
          of Halpin Frayser."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ambrose might not have been a skeptic, but reading his works indicates
          that he was not into mysteries and esoterism, even if he is mainly
          known as a horror writer. For example, "The Devil's Dictionary"
          defines ghosts as "the outward and visible sign of an inward fear."
          About Freemasons, Ambrose writes that their sign is strangely found
          worldwide but only by Freemasons. And lastly, esoterism is known
          as&nbsp; "Very particularly abstruse and consummately occult."
        </p>

          disappearance and claimed Ancient Alien legacy in episode 22. Please
