          Good science communication is something we can&rsquo;t value highly
          enough. Many of us are trying to share our passion with the public,
          the mediums for which have grown exponentially. But still the big two
          sources for the communication I&rsquo;d argue is still the news and
          documentary film.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Skeptoid media did release their movie &ldquo;<a
            href="https://sciencefriction.tv/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Science friction</a
          >&rdquo; on Amazon prime and Tubi recently. This project has been in
          the works for a couple of years and have previously made it quite well
          in a number of movie festivals.

          The documentary is exploring the darker side of science communication.
          It&rsquo;s not a new fact that scientists and experts have been
          misrepresented, cleverly cut or even lied to. A quick look would show
          you that this issue is not new or even that small. You have examples
          such as &ldquo;<a
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/19/channel4.climatechange"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Channel 4&rsquo; - The Great Global Warming Swindle</em></a
          >&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a

            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Seaspirary</em></a
          >&rdquo; among others.
        </p>
        <p>
          What &ldquo;Science friction&rdquo; offers is a chance for scientists
          and science communicators to share their experience with shows such as
          Strange Evidence. Dr. David S. Andersson does explain the tactics from
          Ancient Aliens and gives viewers an understanding on how shows like
          this work and their methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Science Friction feels as if it&rsquo;s split in two parts, one where
          the target seems to be targeted to the general public. The second
          seems to be more of a warning towards scientists. Even though the
          documentary is fascinating and never dull I feel as if we&rsquo;re
          missing something.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We hear and see clips from Ancient Aliens but we never hear from
          anyone who appeared on the show itself. Dr. David S. Andersson does a
          fantastic job, but we don&rsquo;t get to understand how Ancient Aliens
          managed to get &ldquo;non-believers&rdquo; on.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>Through the looking glass of Ancient Aliens</h4>
        <p>
          But by luck and coincidence I had been in contact through email with
          <a href="https://www.saraseager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Professor Sara Seager </a
          >who appeared as a talking head on the show on and off for three
          seasons. I had asked her a few questions and her answers are presented
          here.

        <p><strong>- Do you regret participating in this tv-show?</strong></p>
        <p>
          That kind of question is not part of my approach to life. This is the
          first time I&rsquo;ve considered the question about the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >- Do you feel misled by the production team behind it?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          No, but perhaps somewhat. Some background. The initial pilot program
          production apparently interviewed an equal number of proponents as
          opponents of the Ancient Alien Theory. The interviewer of the original
          pilot (who had a larger role, perhaps as producer and director?) was
          very knowledgeable, passionate about the subject, and sincere. So
          imagine my surprise when I watched the pilot program and saw about 95%
          proponents and 5% opponents. I also noticed the proponents were
          engaging and charming whereas the opponents were more boring and
          &ldquo;robotic&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p><strong>- How long was an interview with the team&nbsp;</strong></p>
        <p>One to two hours, about 2x per year.</p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >- Do you feel as if they tried to guide your answer or set up for
            quote mining?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes but this is typical, even of more reputable programs, for
          efficiency. They sent me a list of questions in advance and I aimed to
          give brief answers. All questions are optional so some I would skip if
          it wasn&rsquo;t my area of knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >- You participated in three seasons if I'm not mistaken. Why not
            less or more?</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I typically don&rsquo;t watch the shows I film for, because there are
          too many of them. At some point various colleagues would ask why I was
          on Ancient Aliens. I&rsquo;d respond, &ldquo;why are you watching such
          a show?&rdquo; We understand the show is for entertainment though some
          might take it too seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;At one point, one of my graduate students said he was very
          disappointed in me for being on the show. So I thought I should check
          it out. I saw that I was being featured as a supporter of all kinds of
          crazy ideas. This would be me defining or describing a concept and
          then the show would move to someone else or the narrator providing
          support for the crazy theory.&nbsp; Whatever follow up statement I
          gave during that interview about why the crazy concept was wrong would
          be missing.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So I thought I&rsquo;d give it one more shot, during an interview
          giving the definition and negative statement all in one breath. What
          resulted was my statements being chopped up mid sentence, very
          obviously so. At this point I knew I was being misled, but it was more
          me not paying attention, as nothing was promised or bigger picture
          described, except for the pilot program. Result:&nbsp; I decided to
          stop participating in the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think Ancient Aliens may be re-using my old footage in newer shows,
          but I&rsquo;m not sure since I don&rsquo;t watch it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recently someone from the show&rsquo;s production side asked if I was
          interested in being on it again. I said no and explained why. No one
          cares. &ldquo;Race to the bottom&rdquo; as my husband says.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thing people wonder is why was I on the show at all?&nbsp; I
          love speculation and imagination about all the possibilities out there
          &mdash; as long as the support or in this case lack thereof is
          presented. There are unsolved mysteries out there and the world should
          know about them.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>But why though?</h4>
        <p>
          I would have liked it if &ldquo;Science Friction&rdquo; asked the
          question &ldquo;why&rdquo; more. Even if it&rsquo;s somewhat answered
          in the interviews with Ben Radford and Scott Mardis &ldquo;Science
          friction&rdquo; does not really try to answer this. Sure, I think the
          answer could be best described as &ldquo;Even within a public service
          broadcaster like the BBC with a remit for education, every programme
          lives or dies by the number of viewers or listeners it gets&rdquo;
          (Murduc 2010).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But if we want to do better we need to understand the intended viewer
          in a sense to avoid a boomerang effect. We&rsquo;ve seen that for
          example &ldquo;Climate change denialism&rdquo; has cemented down by
          party lines (Hart and Nisbet, 2011). People tend to want to see what
          they already believe in. The networks clearly have this formula worked
          out but how do we break it?
        </p>
        <h4>Is there an escape?</h4>
        <p>
          We don&rsquo;t really get an answer to this either, I felt afterward.
          Rather the opposite when Alison Van Eenennaam and Steven Novella
          talking about their experiences on shows like Dr. Oz and Opera. We
          have a rather bleak comment saying &ldquo;the scientists never win in
          the editing room&rdquo;.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I think the hope from the
          <a
            href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1804460/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >director Emery Emery</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://skeptoid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >producer Brian Dunning</a
          >
          was to get the audience riled up and demand better TV. Because we
          don&rsquo;t really get any way forward from the film. I would have
          liked to hear more of different solutions and ways forward. Especially
          from the interviewees who could offer this from an inside
          perspective.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Sure, Vincent Campell covers a lot of this in his book &ldquo;Science,
          Entertainment and Television Documentary&rdquo;. We also have attempts
          to guide scientists such as &ldquo;Introducing science communication :
          a practical guide&rdquo;. These things are a good start but I think we
          in the scientific community need to talk even more about these things
          and help each other. Sure, being misquoted on a TV-show about aliens
          might not be harmful. But these methods are used in more sinister
          settings such as anti-vax (that&rsquo;s covered in Science friction)
          and how to break though there has been a long going discussion (Kahan,
          2013).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We should not forget that there&rsquo;s
          <a
            href="https://www.documentary.org/feature/what-do-about-documentary-distortion-toward-code-ethics"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >discussion among the documentary makers too</a
          >. Just as important we need to think on how we communicate our
          research and how it&rsquo;s made (West and Bergstrom, 2021). So
          finding a quick and easy fix isn&rsquo;t in the stars so to say. But
          with us starting to talk more among each other and with all the
          different parties there might be a way forward. Maybe there&rsquo;s a
          need for a larger organization who can help coordinate talks and make
          demands on a market who desperately needs it.
        </p>
        <h4>How about that elephant over there?</h4>
        <p>
          Then there&rsquo;s the elephant in the, well, sofa I assume. Dawkins
          and Shermer's appearance in the show felt off in light of previous
          events. I want a skeptic movement that&rsquo;s inclusive, safe and
          strong. These two are not symbols of this and I would not have an
          issue with them being there if they&rsquo;ve tried to become better.
          But they&rsquo;ve not and to be fair, the documentary would have
          survived and maybe even been better without them. There&rsquo;s far
          more interesting people out there to be fair and even if these two
          were a big deal before, they aren&rsquo;t any longer.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4>All in all</h4>
        <p>
          Should you watch this documentary? Well yes, it does have something to
          say and I think it&rsquo;s important to understand how this business
          works. It might not have all the answers or ask all the questions but
          it&rsquo;s a start. Even more important is that you and I start to
          demand more from networks, producers and maybe even each other.
          Together I do believe that we can make infodocutaiment better and more
          important scientific correct.
