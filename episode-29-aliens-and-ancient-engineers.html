          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 29. This time around,
          we're going to look at feats of engineering. Could some be evidence of
          extraterrestrial interference? Well, probably not, but let's
          investigate these locations and the claims surrounding them. I'll
          start you out in a small village in Peru named Ollantaytambo, once
          part of the Inka empire. Next, it's time for some math problems with
          Tsoukalos in Teotihuac&aacute;n and Indian architecture with David
          Childress. Lastly, we will go to Karnak and Malta to look at a few
          temples the proponent claims are impossible to create with the tools
          available at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode is based on &ldquo;<em>Aliens and ancient Engineers</em
          >&rdquo; episode six from season three (S03E06).

          Let's meet these ancient engineers and see what we find. We start our
          journey in Peru, some 70 kilometers northwest of Cusco, in a small
          village called Ollantaytambo. Interestingly, this little hamlet is a
          living ruin. While some changes have been made, especially around the
          old plaza, the people still live in the old buildings. Old Inka
          structures are being used until this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can't be blamed for not knowing about this place. While it once
          was an important place, it's even to this day not well researched.
          It's one of these places that archeologists and others need to pay
          more attention to. But from my research into this place, it might have
          started to pick up. But for a long time, Jean-Pierre Protzen was one
          of the few researching this location. This name might be familiar if
          you have been listening to this show for some time. Protzen has done a
          fantastic job on Inka's stonework and architecture and paid
          much-deserved attention to locations others have not.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we do know about Ollantaytambo is that it has been there since
          before the Inka Empire. We should remember that the Inka Empire was
          only around for about 100 years. I think we easily forget this and
          that they operated around 1400 CE until the Spanish conquest. But the
          history before Inka for Ollantaytambo is unclear and needs more
          research. Around 1450 the town was razed by Pachakutiq Inka Yupanki,
          who later would start to rebuild the settlement and incorporate it
          into his palace. Pachacuti is the one who set the Inka on their way to
          becoming an empire, so it's maybe fitting that he restarted this
          settlement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ollantaytambo is right in the Urubamba valley, where a river with the
          same name flows. The settlement is located north of the river and on
          the other side runs one of the four main roads of the Inka empire.
          Four roads stretched out across the kingdom from the main square in
          Cusco. You could say that all roads in Tawantinsuyu lead to Cusco. To
          cross the river, the residents of Ollantaytambo used a bridge from
          which we can still see the original fundaments today.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hear you. What about the aliens? Yes, yes, we will get to that now.
          To be honest, this section is mainly based on false dichotomies, word
          association, and misrepresentation. It does not get further than the
          first two talking heads before we get some issues. The show wants the
          site to be much older than it is; in fact, Brien Foerster (a tour
          guide and self-proclaimed expert) claims the site is "12 000 years
          old." While it's plausible, I mean, we have Monte Verde in Chile dated
          to 16 000 BP and Pikimachay Cave dated to around 12 000 BCE. This
          early date is not connected in any way to the structures we see today.
          The old date is supposed to be reinforced by Jesus Gamarra, which the
          show claim is an anthropologist. Gamarra never mentions any education
          in his bios; instead, he focuses more on his idea that there was less
          gravity in the past. That's how people in our history could
          effortlessly build and move large stones.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might start to suspect, the theory of Ancient Aliens is that
          the site is not Inkan but instead from a much older unknown
          civilization. It's not clear why the Inka can't do it since they, in
          previous episodes, claim that they had some stone-melting ability. But
          the whole Ancient Astronaut idea is, for the most part, built upon
          logical fallacies, the same issue the other "Alternative History"
          people like Graham Hancock struggle with. Let's look at what they
          claim must have been done with alien technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show will talk about what is called a fortress, this is an old
          contact period idea. What they talk about is, in fact, part of the
          temple area. Within this section of the town, located uphill from the
          river, a "Wall of the six." These are large monolithic stones of red
          granite. The proponents claim that these stones would be impossible to
          cut, transport, or anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >These six giant slabs of red granite have stood here for thousands
            of years because of the beautiful engineering of the ancients. If
            there's a major earthquake, these shims can ride up and down,
            absorbing the shock of the earthquake, and that keeps the giant
            slabs in place. The ability to fit perfectly- fitting stones of
            several tons in weight together so that a single human hair can't
            fit in between them is not a question of sweat or man-hours, it's a
            question of technology.</em

          This wall is intriguing for sure and a marvel in a sense. It differs
          quite a lot from the architecture the Inka used elsewhere. We see
          these large monolithic boulders, and if you look closely, you'll start
          to note that they have a bond of narrow fillet stones. We don't really
          see this in other locations. Why they decided to change up the
          architecture here is still being determined. But note that everything
          else around this structure is well-understood Inka architecture. The
          show never mentions it, but this temple was never finished. In fact,
          it's predominantly an abandoned construction site. In a sense, this is
          a perfect place if you want to figure out how the Inka people made
          these constructions. And evidence ranging from quarrying, moving,
          dressing, and building can be found all over the site.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Something I find a little amusing is that the show has an owner of
          some mining company who says that if we moved stones like this today,
          we would need to build roads and use machinery. The Ancient Alien
          proponents use this to make you go, "that sounds like a lot." The Inka
          did not have any machines, but they built ramps to move these stones,
          which are still there today. I want to stress that these stones were
          not quarried as we think of today directly from the mountain. The
          quarry site for Ollantaytambo was some five to seven kilometers away,
          located at the Kachiqhata, some 400 meters above the valley floor.
          This area is notorious for rockslides, and it seems as if the Inka
          used the large boulders they found in these areas. They then dressed
          them roughly and started to transport them. Hammerstones and tools
          have been found, fewer than we would like to see, but enough to give
          us an idea about the process.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          At the quarry and the "fortification," we have stones in different
          stages of building stages. We even have in-situ examples of stones
          being transported. Lisbet Bengtsson found one giant megalith in front
          of one ramp, ready to go. When the megalith (estimated to weigh 70
          tons) was excavated, they found tree trunks beneath it. So in all
          likelihood, the Inka moved the stones using rollers. None of this is
          making it into the Ancient Alien narrative. Listen here to our friend
          Bill Birnes explaining how they really moved the rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >What you can't explain is the moving of 50-ton stones up the sheer
            face of a cliff to create the walls of the fortress. That, in and of
            itself, required more than cranes, more than lifts, more than
            scaffolds. It required something like an anti-gravitational device
            or a tractor beam to lift that much stone that high. That's why
            people see this as an example of help given to an earthly
            civilization by Ancient Aliens.</em
          >" - Bill Birnes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kachiqhata might be uphill, but it's just downhill for most of the
          distance. It's part inside the Ollantaytambo where it begins to be
          uphill again. This section is an excellent example of how little these
          experts know about these sites. For the most part, the research I've
          used is not new. Protzen has been publishing since the '80s, and
          Bengtsson's extensive excavation and study was in the '90s. You must
          actively ignore and cherry-pick your evidence for the pseudoscientific
          narrative to work. Add to this the C14 datings Bengtsson's team
          performed on material found beneath and between these boulders dating
          the fortress building between 1450 to 1530 CE. Quite far from the
          ancient civilization Brien Foerster talk about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we're still going here. Because now, the show will bring up
          something strange. The narrator starts to talk about the "Temple of
          the Condor" here at Ollantaytambo. I'm no specialist in Inka culture,
          but even I know this location is at Machu Picchu. I wonder why they
          decided to rename this place; the only ones using this name are travel
          blogs repeating Giorgio and Brien Foerster's claims. If you ask me,
          this is quite a red flag. Sorry and a quick mention of a book written
          on the structure by a group of Civil Engineers who otherwise use the
          correct name. All other literature on this building uses the name
          Incamisana or maybe, in some cases, "the water temple."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Incamisana was built by Pachacuti, the leader who destroyed the
          original settlement, as his kind of vacation home. Within this
          complex, he set up some intricate waterwork, hence the water temple
          name. It's a beautifully crafted space, and the Inka aqueduct system
          and water engineering are impressive. But they talk about something
          different; instead, we're focusing on a niche on one of the mountain
          walls. If you see this, you might think about the "portal" at Altarini
          close to Tiwanaku. We covered it in episode 13, where Jose Luis
          Delgado Mamani claimed that the Inka carved this niche and was called
          the "Gate of the Gods." We, on the other hand, learned this type of
          niche is usually called an "Inka chair" and can be found all over the
          Inka world. If they had had a wider shot of the "Wall of the six," we
          would have seen a different version of this Inka chair. This niche is
          rare in the literature since it's not the mystery as these alternative
          history types suggest. I want you to listen to Von D&auml;niken, and
          pay close attention to the false dilemma he sets up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Prehistoric tools would never work. You see, Ollantaytambo is mostly
          made out of andesite. To cut andesite, you need something which is
          harder than andesite. You could use a diamond, but there was no tool
          in Stone Age time to cut these rocks, so it must have been
          extraterrestrial tool." - Erich Von D&auml;niken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is andesite a hard rock? Yes, it is a relatively hard rock. But note
          how he set up that either they had diamond-tipped tools or must have
          used alien technology. We get two choices when there are, in fact, a
          multitude of answers to this question in reality. This is an excellent
          example if you're unfamiliar with what a false dilemma is. Brien
          Foerster, Giorgio Tsoukalos, and von D&auml;niken mainly focus on the
          crisscross pattern that can be found on the seat of this chair. The
          details are exquisite, so good that "<em
            >American Society of Civil Engineers</em
          >" wrote in a large study that: "<em
            >This type of rock carving by ancient Inca craftsmen is the reason
            that myths have evolved over the decades as to how they were
            created</em
          >." Adding a "<em>No, they were not made by extraterrestrials</em>" at
          the end of the passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what did they use if we didn't need lasers or diamond-tipped
          tools? Here is one of those disappointing answers; we're not entirely
          sure. More research on the subject might lead us to some more
          fulfilling answers. There have been experiments where people carved
          granite using flint tools. So a more practical tool was probably used;
          we have not yet found any good example. If we were to use von
          D&auml;nikens logic about needing diamond tools, would not stone
          masonry in medieval times have been impossible? Iron is softer in
          comparison, yet people still use metal tools to carve granite.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the aliens might not have created Ollantaytambo; after the break,
          we will head a little bit north in the Americas to Teotihuac&aacute;n.
        </p>
        <h3 id="Teotihuacan">Teotihuac&aacute;n</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome back! Let's continue the hunt for evidence of ancient alien
          technology. We're taken to what was at one point the largest city in
          maybe the whole Americas. At its height, Teotihuac&aacute;n covered
          probably more than 30 square kilometers and, at the peak, had some 150
          000 inhabitants. The area was first settled around 600 BCE, but at
          first, it consisted of scattered villages and smaller settlements. But
          we see a large influx of people around 100-150 BCE, mainly from the
          pre-classic city of Cuicuilco. Some believe Cuicuilco to be the first
          larger city in Mesoamerica and might have housed up to 20 000 people.
          Due to a volcanic eruption, Cuicuilco was abandoned. There is an
          influx of people from other parts, mainly from the valleys south of
          Lake Texcoco. So this city grew quickly in something nobody had seen
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why are we here? I'll present you with the narrator's claim here,
          and listen closely to see if you find something weird.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"According to scholars, the advanced design of Teotihuac&aacute;n
            suggests that ancient builders had knowledge, not only of
            architecture, but of complex mathematical and astronomical sciences.
            From the air, the city's layout strangely resembles a computer
            circuit board with two large processor chips &ndash; the Sun Pyramid
            and the Moon Pyramid. Researchers have also found numerous and
            remarkable similarities to the Great Pyramids of Egypt." -
            Narrator</em
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did you notice anything standing out? The processor part, right? Yes,
          I wondered where they would go with that, too, but it only fizzled
          out. When they talk about the city's layout here, they don't discuss
          the whole town. This is mainly focused on the Avenue of the Dead,
          Pyramid of the Sun and Pyramid of the Moon. I also wonder why they
          would need dual CPUs for their alien technology. Today, except for in
          some server motherboards, we rarely use or need dual CPUs. If we can
          create products with 64 cores and 128 threads, imagine what a
          space-traveling civilization would use. I never thought Linus Tech
          Tips would be referenced in this show, but here we go. Linus does have
          a video explaining why dual CPUs never took off and show a couple of
          examples. None looks like the layout of this quarter in
          Teotihuac&aacute;n. But I digress.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to math, the Mayans were pretty sophisticated. They used
          a base 20-system and were using the concept of zero. Their numbers
          were represented by dots and lines, except zero, which was usually
          represented by a shell. One was written as one dot, and then you add a
          dot until you reach five, which is characterized by a line. You then
          have a bar and a dot just as one to four. On 10 and 15, you increase
          the bars. As you get to 20 and above, we add a dot on the side of the
          numeral.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't have much of Mayan mathematical texts, but Hector Calderon
          did in 1966 in the book "<em
            >La ciencia matem&aacute;tica de los mayas</em
          >" reconstruct some of their methods in arithmetics. From the scraps
          preserved to our days, we see that the math used by the Mayans evolved
          over time. It's not as if they one day started to solve equations like
          the Standard Model Lagrangian. Please note that I'm not trying to
          diminish the accomplishment of the Mayans; I'm looking to show you how
          their math should be only attributed to these people. Aliens, Atlantis
          or Lemuria, are not needed to explain the Mayan accomplishments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's quickly look at these claims that the Pyramid of the Sun and
          Khufu are the same. The show makes it sound eerily similar, even using
          math to prove their similarity.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The base perimeter of the Pyramid of the Sun is four Pi times its
            height. In Giza, it's two pi times its height. Essentially, the
            Pyramid of the Sun is exactly half as tall as the Pyramid of Giza." </em
          >-Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not a great mathematician, but even I reacted to this math. The
          Pyramid of the sun is not a square building. Its sides are 720 and 760
          feet (or 220 by 230 meters). For simplicity, we can use the show's
          measurement of 750 feet. The height of the pyramid is 66 meters or 216
          feet. Let's try Tsoukalos equation, so we write it 4&pi; * 216. So
          basically, we have 4 * 3.14159 * 216, which equals 1345.4544. This is
          not close to the base perimeter. Using the shows numbers, the base
          would equal 3000 feet. While Khufus' pyramid fares better, it's still
          not an exact match with Giorgios' math if we don't round it up and
          down to make it fit. Well, it's not Girogio who thought this up but
          Zacharia Sitchin in his book "The lost realms."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if we can find a few similarities, we should not forget all the
          differences. The Pyramid of the sun has an angle of 32 degrees, while
          Kufu has 52 degrees. They have a different volume, 1.2 million cubic
          meters versus 2.6 million cubic meters. One building functioned as a
          temple, while the other was intended to work only as a grave. One
          building was designed to be climbed, and the other was not. They were
          built more than 2000 years apart with different materials and methods.
          We could look at almost anything and find some similarities if we're
          creative enough, but we should also evaluate the differences. In this
          case, they are more different than similar, and as we saw, the
          similarities are only there if we round up and down the numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's also a repetition of the claim that the pyramids of both these
          sites line up with Orion's belt. This is something we in the past have
          concluded only is true if we re-arranging the site's designs,
          something Bauval and Hancock leave out in their book "The Message of
          the Sphinx." Since we have gone into this claim on multiple occasions
          in the past, I'll gloss over this here.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, their claims about Teotihuac&aacute;n haven't really matched
          up to what we know about the site. But could the following claim be
          what we have been looking for? We're told that there is an "<em
            >extensive use of mica embedded in numerous structures</em
          >." This is followed up with that mica can only be found in Brazil,
          3000 miles away. This is simply not true; the mica we find in
          Teotihuac&aacute;n is most likely from Oaxaca by the Pacific coast.
          I'm not sure where they got the 3000 number, but they are most likely
          building on what Graham Hancock wrote in "<em
            >Finger prints of the gods</em
          >" in 1996. Hancock writes, "<em
            >belong to a type which occurs only in Brazil, some 2000 miles
            away</em
          >," and then gives two sources. Sitchin's "<em>The lost realms</em>"
          and Encyclopaedia Britannica were printed in 1991. He references the
          encyclopedia quite strangely, but from what I figure, it should be in
          volume 8, page 90. The issue is that Encyclopaedia Britannica in 1991
          came in two editions, a 32-volume set, and a 15-volume set. I've no
          idea what Hancock used, but Sitchin does not mention the micas'
          origin, so either the encyclopedia of 1991 does, or Hancock is the
          origin of the claim. Also, if there are any younger listeners out
          there, yes, we used to have large volumes of books as our Wikipedia.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's correct that we have some mica spread across the city, with two
          more significant deposits. Proponents of aliens and an "alternative
          history" claim these to be the "Mica Temple" and the "Pyramid of the
          sun." The Mica Temple is among archaeologists more known as "The
          Viking group." This is due to a grant from the American Viking
          Foundation, today more known as the Wenner-Gren foundation. This work
          was led by Pedro Armillas and Jos&eacute; Perez between 1942 and 1944
          and was an apartment compound for a noble family. So it was within
          this complex we found this deposit under or on floor level.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second location is claimed to have been in the Pyramid of the sun.
          This idea comes from Peter Tompkins, a journalist turned new-age
          writer. He claims in "<em>Mysteries of the Mexican pyramids</em>" (p
          202) that Leopold Batres was told about an undocumented find of mica
          within the pyramid. This was then lost or carried away, according to
          Tompkins. Graham Hancock repeats this idea but accuses Batres of
          selling the find due to the value of mica. But the second location is
          still preserved in the Xalla Complex. This is another palatial
          building in the area, so these two deposits are found within buildings
          tied to noble and wealthy people.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they talk about the electrical properties, heat resistance, and
          whatnot, these were not things important to the Mayans. Most of the
          mica we find is in art, especially in the eyes of statues, makeup, and
          mirrors. What's left out is that mica was used as a pigment in cave
          paintings during the paleolithic era. It is a pretty mundane material
          in many ancient civilizations. For example, the Tewa people in North
          America used it to make their ceramic vessels glister. In Pakistan, it
          was added to clothing, especially for women, and in Russia, it was
          used as glass in house windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the mica isn't as unusual as we were led to believe. As it turned
          out, it was used in art and might have been part of a floor. Even if
          the Viking and Xalla deposits are significant, we don't need these
          fantastic claims to explain them. It's also important to note that
          we're never presented with these more mundane explanations in the
          show. Conversely, they are pretty clear that "<em
            >the only possible reasons really why they would be doing this is
            because somehow it was part of some technology.</em
          >" We're told that mica is part of NASA's space crafts and maybe was
          used at Teotihuac&aacute;n to protect the people from the spacecraft
          taking off. Or the mica was used as capacitors in the pyramids to
          offer wireless charging to the space aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So did Ancient Aliens influence the construction of this fantastic
          city? The evidence is not there, so I'm confident to say no. But the
          show must go on as they say. So join me as we travel over to India.
        </p>
        <h3>Vijayanagara</h3>
        <p>
          Located in the modern state of Karnataka in central India, lays the
          ruins of what once was one of the largest cities on earth.
          Vijayanagara was the capital of the Vijayanagara empire and covered
          some 650 square kilometers at its height. More than 500 000 people
          would have lived here on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. But why
          are we here? Well, these ruins might be the work of alien
          construction. Let us have David Childress set the tone here.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Vijayanagara is said to have been built in the 14th-century AD.
            However, there's a lot of evidence to show that it is a much older
            city. And in fact, Hindu legends say that the ancient king, Rama met
            with his monkey god friend, Hanuma they're at a cave at Vijayanagara
            and this would put the city, back many thousands of years.</em
          >" - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          What Childress claims here is not wrong but is something with some
          modification. Vijayanagara is in an arid area, which was true even
          back in the paleolithic era when it started to be settled. Of course,
          it was lusher around the Tungabhadra River, but this river was never
          navigable and was prone to flooding. In the beginning, it was usually
          smaller semi-moveable settlements. This changed around 1000 BCE, and
          we started to see larger villages develop. As time goes into the
          historical era, we begin to see small kingdoms grow, and usually set
          to 1336, the foundation of Vijayanagara begins, and an empire is born.
          At this point in time, we see a massive influx of people, and the city
          grows from its humble beginnings. But we don't really discuss this
          aspect of the site's history; the show will mainly focus on the
          religious center called Hampi.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As for King Rama, yes, he was a king but also the seventh avatar of
          Vishnu. Rama met the god Hanuman, a monkey-looking deity, in a place
          called Kishkindha. In popular culture today, this semimythical place
          is to be located close to the Tungabhadra river and Hampi. But as far
          I can tell, this is not part of the founding myth about the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're going to leave the city for a while to talk about a type of
          architecture special for India, Vastu shastra. Here we get into a
          little issue, Indian culture is often highjacked by white new-age
          people. Vastu shastra seems to have gone the same way as Feng shui and
          other similar traditions here in the west. Listening to how the show
          explains Vastu shastra, we hear common keywords from the new age
          movement, that this practice includes harmony, energies, cosmos, and
          consciousness.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vastu shastra originates in the Hindu religion, and its creation is
          often attributed to the craftsman god Vishwakarma. Around 600 CE, we
          see the earliest known Sanskrit texts circulate on constructing
          temples according to these ideas. It grows from there to include
          palaces and even towns. The city of Janipur is built according to the
          ideas within this tradition. Under British colonial rule, the use of
          Vastu Shastra veined but has recently seen a rebirth. But I think it
          goes without saying that the ideas do not really have any scientific
          anchor; the Federation of Indian Rationalist Associations has been
          highlighting that it's basically pseudoscience today. While the style
          guide might make beautiful temples, it won't change any cosmic
          energies in a measurable way. The tradition has no logical connection
          to create some balance between earth and some unspecified energy,
          except what you, as an observer, might feel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The point we are being served here is that this site is older and
          constructed by gods. So the claims are more or less repeated from
          Ollantaytambo. But it's the same issue; while the site has an earlier
          history, it's not during this time we really see the construction of
          the building we see today. But the Ancient Alien theorist needs to
          move the date back to do the alien construction work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you remember the Vaimānika Shāstra? This book was created by G. R.
          Josyer, who claimed that this "ancient text" was channeled to him in
          1952. We have discussed this before, but within this text, we have
          this idea about Vimanas as some sort of steampunk spaceships. This is
          somewhat referenced in the show but a bit more lowkey. But what we end
          up with is that this city was a sort of ancient spaceport. Yet, the
          preferred narrative from the alienists does not fit with the current
          understanding of the city and the architectural principles mentioned.
          Or not without rewriting history, and they try to do this, but without
          the evidence to back it up, we will revert these changes for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The case for the alien engineers does not look too well, to be honest.
          After the break, we will examine if flipping an image of Ramses II
          will turn out to be the smoking gun and if a small island in the
          Mediterranean used trains more than 5000 years ago.

        <h3 id="Karnak">Karnak&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome back! While we were gone, our surroundings shifted, and we're
          now standing within the temple complex of Karnak in Egypt. What might
          have been the pride of Thebes, the temple complex is massive. Known to
          the ancient Egyptians as Ipet-isut, or "<em
            >The most select of places</em
          >," the complex was expanded by numerous Pharaohs over time. The main
          temple was dedicated to Amun and the Theban triad (Amun, Mut, and
          Khonsu), but as time went by, other temples and gods were
          incorporated. Just like tourists today, we could spend an entire day
          walking around the large temple area. But why are we here? Well, for
          two reasons, obelisks and a sculpture of Ramses II. So let's keep it
          simple and go with the obelisks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The obelisk is carved with the same inscriptions on four sides.
            They're all exactly the same, and they are all beautifully cut and
            articulated hieroglyphs into this red granite stone</em
          >." &ndash; David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >We would look at it today and say that would be some of machine
            that carved these things out. For example, there were slots, they
            were only .14 inches wide, half inch deep. When you look inside you
            can see, the bottom of them were made by a rotating tool. So, this
            was a tool that punched in, came out, stepped down, punched in, came
            out&hellip;the human hand, no matter how good you are, could never
            do that. The tool marks themselves, the precision, the depth, the
            rotating impressions that were made were not done by hand. Some of
            those were so precisely engraved as to require machine tools to do
            it. The tool kit that we see, that the ancient Egyptians were
            supposed to use &ndash; there is no way that any of those tools
            could produce the results that we saw</em
          >." &ndash; Arlan Andrews.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to say, Obelisks are impressive and beautiful things. Standing
          in front of one of them really makes you feel small. But we have two
          claims to deal with; the sides are precisely the same, and the
          carvings have rotating tool marks within them. Let's start with the
          identical sides.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This claim is rather silly in a sense since they obviously are not
          identical in the carvings on all four sides. The show does not help
          Childress when showing an obelisk shot, so two sides are visible
          simultaneously, and these sides have different hieroglyphs as he
          speaks. I'm curious how he came to this idea or why someone would use
          this space to repeat the same sentence. That would be a wasted space
          for bragging, and the Pharaohs loved to brag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take, for example, the obelisks set up by Hatshepsut at Karnak.
          Usually, obelisks are set up in pairs, and Hatshepsut did the same.
          This was so you could set them at the entrance to a temple and have
          some symmetry. Even if some single obelisks are known, they never
          became popular to erect. Hatshepsut erected four obelisks at the
          Karnak temple, but only two have survived until today. In the
          beginning, the obelisks were also gilded, making them even more
          impressive. But on one of the ones preserved, it's written on the
          western and eastern faces as follows.

            the Two lands like the sun disc. Never was the like made since the
            beginning of the world. Made for him by the Son of Re, Hatshepsut

            monument. Because favor was shown to the king of Upper and Lower
            Egypt, Akheperkare (Tuthmosis I), by the majesty of this god, these
            two great obelisks were erected by her majesty for the first time.
            For it was spoken by the lord of the gods, "Your father, the king of
            Upper and Lower Egypt, Akheperkare, gave orders to erect obelisks,
            your majesty shall multiply monuments and live forever.&nbsp;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          As you note, these texts are pretty bold in their statements.
          Hatshepsut claims full credit for creating them and that these are the
          greatest ones ever built. The old Pharaohs loved to use these phrases
          even if their monument was literally in the shadow of their greater
          ancestors. But note that we have a similar start of the text, so it
          could be there he got the idea? But we can at least put this to rest
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's move over to the tool marks and cuts that can't be from stone or
          copper tools. The issue here for Arland Andrew's claim is that we have
          carvings in different stages of completeness. For example, we have a
          granite column from the Temple of Harishef in Heracleopolis with
          multiple signs not fully completed. In the beginning, these signs look
          rough, and you can clearly see the tool marks both in and around the
          characters. When they reach about 2,5 cm (1 inch) deep, they polish
          with a stone the signs, and we get these straight lines we're familiar
          with. If some routing machine were used, we would not see these types
          of tool marks or this process. The rotating effects could easily be
          from the polishing stones and sand used to make it smother, but since
          they don't name the monument where these are "found," it's hard to
          figure out what's happened. So the toolkit of the Egyptian workers
          fits quite well with the evidence we have. Why else would this
          evidence of a process be so visible? This is not a single occurrence
          but something we can see in other unfinished locations.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          During all of this, we are joined by Christoffer Dunn, author of Lost
          Technologies of Ancient Egypt. He claims that the Egyptians created
          things to a precision of 1000 of an inch or more. I'm not sure where
          he gets these details, but that's simply not true. As evidence, Dunn
          is presenting us pictures of a statue in Karnak that depicts Ramses II
          (or&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ramses the great). The statue depicts the head of Ramses, probably
          more once upon a time, from a front perspective. The claim is that the
          sculpture is so precise that if you flip the picture and put it over
          the original, it will align perfectly. Of course, I went online, found
          a similar image, and tried this myself. While the mouth, eyes, nose,
          and facial features line up perfectly. The outline of the face, ears,
          and things like that were off. But I didn't stop with Ramses the
          great. I also tried Nefertiti, Amunhotep III, and others from the New
          Kingdom, and they kind of lined up when inverted. This is less due to
          advanced machinery but more to the style of ancient Egypt. Their art
          is lovely, but it's more of a paint-by-number thing. It was highly
          stylized, and basically, after a grid, even Hatshepsut was depicted
          just as all the other Pharaohs, with a false beard and all. Egyptian
          art was not meant to be realistic. It was supposed to look like it
          always had.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Dunn suggests they used something similar to a router machine and
          shows an aluminum face created with a metal router. Dunn claimed that
          the tool marks left on these are identical to each other; sometimes,
          you see what you want to see. We're faced with another false dilemma
          from David Childress.

          "<em
            >Allegedly they did not have electricity, power tools. Supposedly,
            they didn't have diamond saws. But yet, they're doing things that
            would require precision work, precision tools. So, where did they
            get those things? How could they have had these advanced machining
            tools that we've only just acquired ourselves today in our
            civilization? So one answer would have to be they'd gotten it from
            Ancient Aliens.</em
          >" David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Precision work, yes maybe, but they had rulers, carpenters square, and
          trained professionals. A skilled craftsman today could create a
          duplicate with only chisels. So there are more answers to the question
          that they state than Ancient Aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's move over to our final destination for this time. Malta, a small
          cluster of islands just south of Sicily.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="Malta">Malta</h3>
        <p>
          If you're unfamiliar with Malta, it's a small nation in the
          Mediterranean consisting of three islands, Malta, Gozo, and Kemmuna.
          People have been living here since 6000 to 5000 BCE, and are home to
          some of the world's oldest megalithic structures. Until G&ouml;bekli
          Tepe, some of the megalithic temples were believed to be the oldest in
          the world. While this has now changed, the temples are still ancient
          and still impressive.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest date we have for one of these megalithic temples is about
          3600 BCE on the second-largest island Gozo. The temple-building
          civilization lasted until around 2500 BCE, what's known as the end of
          the Tarxien phase. This phase is named after one of the more
          influential temples of the era located in the village of Tarxien. The
          reason we're here is, of course, that these temples are too complex
          for the people of the time to have built. Let's listen to Patrick
          Flanagan.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's<em>
            only been in recent years, that we developed instruments, that are
            accurate enough to appreciate that some of these ancient societies
            were able to shape stones to optical accuracy, optical accuracy
            greater that we are able to do today. And so they must have had some
            kind of advanced technology enabling them to do that.</em
          >" - Patrick Flanagan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flanagan is new to the show but not new in the pseudoscientific
          circles. He authored a book named "Pyramid power" in 1975, following
          that one up with four sequels. He is in the show titled p.hd, and he
          is referred to as Dr. Patrick Flanagan TM on his website. But his Alma
          mater is nowhere to be found on his web pages. After some searching,
          it seems to be either "Medicina Alternativa" or "The Open
          International University for Complementary Medicines." Both have signs
          of being diploma mills. I reached out to the Patrick Flanagan library,
          which kindly answered my question regardings Flanagans Alma Mater. It
          turns out that it is an M.D. from Medicina Alternativa based in
          Singapore.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what we get here from Patrick is some tech word salad. Optical
          accuracy isn't a term used in the literature, and the definition is
          highly unclear since when it's used, it's often about quality control
          by just looking at something. I've been to several of the temples in
          Malta; I highly recommend visiting if you can. Thinking about it, I've
          been at three of five locations in this episode. Can you guess what
          other two I've been at? They are marvels, but their construction is
          almost the opposite of a mystery.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of imported flint and obsidian, they primarily quarried
          two types of limestone: coralline and globigerina. They most likely
          also used wooden levers and wedges to break off blocks using natural
          faultlines in the stone. When a block of the desired size was broken
          off, it was rolled on rollers to the site. On location, they used
          stone balls to get the blocks to their final destination. A few of
          these stone spheres have been found in temple locations. To get the
          stone on top of the others, they built ramps out of dirt that later
          was dismantled.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It's impressive that the early settlers of Malta would be able to,
          with simple means, build these great monuments. Yet the show deems it
          unlikely and wonders if there was a railway on the island to
          facilitate the transport of the megaliths. On Malta, there's something
          usually referred to as cart ruts. It looks like two parallel tracks in
          the limestone, and it looks like it was made by carts over a long
          time. The most likely explanation is also that it is from actual
          cartwheels. While there is a discussion on exactly when and how they
          are formed, we can rule out a few things the show mentions. Such as
          they are not 10 000 years old, and they are not all identical in size
          and width.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of them are V-shaped, so they start wider and then become more
          narrow toward the bottom. The depth is usually deeper in places that
          slope compared to flat locations. This would support the theory that
          the ruts were started by carts, and then erosion from water and wind
          has created these deep scars in the soft limestone. While there is
          some harder limestone on the islands, much of it is delicate and
          sensitive to erosion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A study from last year has picked up the research on the Maltese cart
          ruts, but as the author Groucutt mentions, a lot more research is
          needed to comprehensively understand these marks.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we bring up the Hypogeum; I was never inside, unfortunately,
          since you have to get tickets well in advance. This underground temple
          is carved from the mountain to resemble the Megalithic temples above.
          The earliest date is close to 4000 BCE, and within this complex is a
          room referred to as the Oracle Room. Now, this room has some rather
          remarkable features. Frequencies within the 70Hz and 114Hz range will
          enhance and echo throughout the complex. According to the show, it's
          evidence that the people of Malta had access to acoustic levitation
          and could reshape matter with the help of this room. But it's simply
          not true; while acoustic archaeology within the complex has been
          limited, it seems more natural than manmade.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          In the next episode, it&rsquo;s time for what you might have been
          waiting for since November. Graham Hancocks &ldquo;<em
            >Ancient Apocalypse.</em
          >&rdquo; I know he lacks alien visitors in most of his work, but since
          he has appeared on this show and is known to have spread some fringe
          ideas, we should have a look at his ideas at least.&nbsp;
