          An archaeologist discussing Rasputin, the famous scapegoats from the
          Russian Revolution, Nazi symbology, and the stigmatization of mental
          health in pop culture? Yes, you do want to hear this.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we will talk about how Ancient Aliens and similar shows add to
          the stigma of mental health with the claims they make in their show.
          Then we move on to talk about the Rasputin myth, and while finding out
          who he really was, we learn that many of the pop myths about him are
          incredibly unfair. Last out, we will deal with the Nazi Symbol called
          the Black Sun. Some claim it's drawn from Norse sources. We will
          discover that's far from the case and that the neo nazi mythology
          circulating about it originates from a 1991 novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 48, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This episode premieres on the day of Halloween,
          and could it be that we're in for another spooktacular? To some
          extent, but not really, to be honest. While the episode "<em
            >Dark Forces"</em
          >
          from season 10, episode 4, does its best to be perceived as scary or
          spooky, I find many problematic things. This episode will not deal
          much with archaeology, to be honest, but we will have some thrilling
          discussions. First, we will talk about how Ancient Aliens and similar
          shows add to the stigma of mental health with the claims they make in
          their show. Then we move on to talk about the Rasputin myth, and while
          finding out who he really was, we learn that many of the pop myths
          about him are incredibly wrong. Last out, we will deal with the Nazi
          Symbol called the Black Sun. Some claim it's drawn from Norse sources.
          We will discover that's far from the case and that the neo nazi
          mythology circulating about it originates from a 1991 novel.

          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. And if you like the
          podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of those fancy
          five-star reviews I've heard so much about.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you want to learn how to support the show and the
          Archaeological Podcast Network, I will tell you more at the end of the
          episode. Books and stuff aren't free, you know.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we start the show, I just want to say that while discussing
          mental health, it will be a more academic discussion. But if you
          struggle and need someone to talk to, you can call the US hotline 988.
          If you listen from another country, I've added more resources in the
          episode description here in your podcast app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="mentalhealth">Mental health and popculture</h2>
        <p>
          I've repeatedly said this show is dangerous, and I'm prepared to sound
          like a broken record here. Let's just listen to the first claim of the
          show.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Richard Ramirez, the "Night Stalker." Found guilty of killing 13
            people. He claims to be "a minion of Satan sent to Earth to carry
            out atrocities for the Devil." David Berkowitz, "Son of Sam."
            Charged with killing six people and wounding seven others. He stated
            that he was a "soldier in a Satanic army." Ted Bundy. Serial killer
            and rapist. Arrested in connection with over 36 murders. He alleged
            that something overtook him while committing the crimes. He called
            it "the entity." Were these men simply delusional, or could their
            claims that they were compelled to violence by dark entities
            actually be true?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to be blunt here. There's nothing scary, dark, or spooky
          here. Or rather, the frightening thing is how the showwriters again
          try to demonize mental illness. I know we covered this in part while
          exploring the myths surrounding the Aikogohara Forrest, but I will
          continue here on a bit of a different track.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I can somewhat understand the fascination some have for serial
          killers, I don't really get it. However, I see a danger in how they
          are portrayed here, both that the diagnoses are speculations and the
          connection between satan and disorders. I've not found that these
          three were officially diagnosed, and most of the assumptions about
          their conditions are from people who have never met them. While
          understanding their mental health can be significant, it's most
          interesting because we could potentially help people before it's too
          late. That's what I'm going to say about these men.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might wonder what the issue here is, and that's fine; some of you
          might know where this conversation might go. There is an issue of
          stigmatization around mental disorders in our society. Ancient Aliens
          manage to contribute both toward the religious stigma of mental health
          and the idea that people with mental health are evil and dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          That people within the religious communities have a built-in stigma
          originating from their fate should not come as a considerable
          surprise. Several studies have been published in the area, both from
          religious and secular publications. Most of the studies in the English
          language tend to, no surprise, focus on the Abrahamic religions. That
          includes Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. This is a fact I just
          wanted to highlight, so the discussion we're having here is slightly
          skewed toward the Western world. I just wanted to point out this lack
          of data in case you have questions or wondering why I don't bring
          other cultures up here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as I mentioned, studies have been done on the connection between
          mental illness, religion, and stigma for some time. Many point out
          that connecting mental illness with sin and immorality leads to the
          symptoms being viewed as something the individual is responsible for
          and has caused on themself. As Lloyd and Panagopoulos (2022) point
          out, there is "<em
            >harmful to individuals as they confate sufering with individual
            responsibility, such as by blaming the person's lack of faith or
            sinful behaviour</em
          >." Blaming the cause of mental illness on an outside force leads to
          the idea that the individual could have prevented this by acting
          differently. In a 2023 article, Lloyd and Panagopoulos state that
          these ideas "<em
            >lead to diminished treatment-seeking and unhelpful interventions
            which view the individual as at fault for their illness and position
            them as a passive recipient of spiritual intervention</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't fare better in the Muslim communities where mental illness to
          this day is blamed in many communities as being possessed or caused by
          the Jinn. Authors within the Muslim world point out that while there
          is no connection between mental illness and jinn possession in the
          Qur'an, the belief is firmly rooted within folk superstition. Islam
          and Campbell write in a 2012 article the rather sad statement that
          "self-stigma because he/she has grown up believing that the devil
          causes madness and community/family stigma, because they too have
          grown up with this idea. Such shame and stigma understandably results
          in Muslims either failing to seek or significantly underutilizing
          much-needed mental healthcare treatment."
        </p>
        <p>
          What we see here in the religious context we also see within the Alien
          sphere. It's not unknown that people believe to have been abducted by
          aliens, encountered them, or, in cases they think to be possessed of
          them, often don't seek medical treatment. Or maybe even worse, go to
          memory regression therapy, hypnotists, and support groups where their
          beliefs are confirmed and aggravated. While they don't necessarily
          face the stigma as their religious counterparts, they still hesitate
          to seek out medical professionals. For example, we brought up these
          things in episode 44, "<a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-44-alien-abduction.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Alien abductions, kachinas, and Peru's elongated skulls</a
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          There's also ample evidence that the portrayal of mental health in
          popular media affects how we view disorders and treatments. So a lot
          of responsibility falls on the writers here, but unfortunately, they
          decide to use to portray mental illness as something evil. Something
          dangerous and violent. Worth pointing out is that Ancient Aliens are
          not the only popular media that engage with this trope and try to make
          content out of it. It's been around for a long time. The first time
          the "scary doctor" trope appeared on film was in 1914 with the movie
          "Andy and the Hypnotist." In which a young man is put under the
          control of a nefarious doctor by hypnosis. But the hypnotist, named
          Mysterio, is arrested by a Children's Society agent, and Andy ends up
          on an intended murderous spree acting as a Native American. With this,
          a new genre was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phenomenon has been quite well studied, and Hayden et al. have
          classified the negative stereotypes as follows. First, we have the
          homicidal maniac that appears in films such as Psyco, american psycho,
          and the exorcist. Then we have the rebellious free spirit labeled
          mentally ill by society, but in the end, they are vindicated since
          nice characters can't be mentally ill. Moving on, we have
          run-of-the-mill enlightened members of society, as depicted in King of
          Hearts. The female patient is a seductress, the narcissistic parasite,
          and lastly, the zoo specimen.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you think back about a movie depicting someone with mental health,
          I'm sure you can start to see how that character is problematic. Even
          if they are not shown as dangerous, the stereotypes are still harmful,
          even if it's the lovable free spirit portrayed as a trope leading to
          destructive ideas about mental illness and health. There is a clear
          link between the stigma around mental illness and the discrimination
          of these people in areas such as housing, employment, relationships,
          and even funding for treatment centers or mental health equality.
          Leading in the end to a loss of status, low self-esteem, shame,
          withdrawal, and less likely to seek professional help. Much of this
          seems, unfortunately, rooted in the media's portrayal of mental
          health.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2002, six out of ten of the most popular violent movies included
          someone suffering from mental illness. The characters are often
          referred to with derogatory terms and often have the villain reported
          to be mentally ill, as we see in the Halloween movies. Among the top
          100 films from 2016 and 2017 and the 100 top-rated series, in 46% of
          those involving a mentally ill character, this character was the
          perpetrator of violence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perciful and Meyers published a study in 2016 where they aimed to see
          how movies affect a person's attitudes toward people with
          schizophrenia. When shown films with a fear-based portrayal, the
          subjects supported stigmatizing attitudes such as "<em
            >I would be afraid to meet somebody who has schizophrenia</em
          >" and "<em
            >People with schizophrenia need to be supervised at all times</em
          >." Compare these results with the control group and the group who saw
          positive presentations of schizophrenia, where the attitudes improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The media representation not only affects society's view about mental
          health but can also skew and hinder advancing knowledge about mental
          health. Further, as we touched on, the stigma born from these
          portrayals leads to people not seeking medical help even if they feel
          that they would need it. It's also been demonstrated that even if help
          is sought, people don't stick with the treatment due to the stigma
          enforced by films directed at adults and children. The health care
          portrayed in the movie also sets unrealistic expectations on how the
          treatment will be and how a mental facility will look and work. Again,
          this hinders people from seeking treatment due to being afraid of
          being "turned into a zombie" or getting shock treatment, a treatment
          that, in some cases, might help alleviate some symptoms. But if your
          picture of how a mental facility operates is influenced by movies, you
          might not want to seek it out, fearing becoming Jack Nicolson's
          character in A Flight over the Coco Nest. A common trope is that you
          will be locked up indefinitely if you don't do what the medical
          professional wants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even less extreme examples of mental health professionals often set
          unrealistic standards where the cure often is love and family. Two
          things that can benefit someone undergoing treatment but should not be
          deemed the only cure. Media also tend to cultivate a myth that
          psychiatry can be anything and therapy can be anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to round up this segment, we have demonstrated how movies and
          religion affect our views and often in a way that increases the stigma
          around mental health. While there are, of course, potential upsides if
          used positively, this is not really the current case. And even if
          Ancient Aliens is not the most prominent show out there, they still
          contribute to these ideas and need to take responsibility for this.
          Because this is not the first time we have seen this depiction, and
          from the look, this will continue in later episodes. This is something
          I've mentioned and certainly will do in the future. Ancient Aliens are
          a harmful show in more ways than promoting alien theories; they
          stigmatize people suffering from mental health issues. On that very
          upbeat note, I'll go and cool off the nerves with some whiskey while
          you listen to a couple of messages.

        <h2 id="rasputin">The maybe not-so-mad monk Rasputin</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back. We have now moved from the demonic realm to Russia,
          where we will encounter perhaps one of the more famous and most
          misunderstood figures from the Russian Revolution. Grigori Rasputin. A
          name that has become almost a synonym for evil and villainy. He even
          appears as the main bad guy in the, well now, Disney movie Anastasia.
          There is so much legend about this man that scholars, as we will
          learn, have difficulty separating truth from fiction. Very little
          academic work seems to have been written about Rasputin, especially in
          English. There are, however, tons of popular science books and
          articles on him with a wide variety of quality. More has been
          published in Russian, of course, and Rasputin seems to appear in
          several memoirs of people from the era. The drawback is that I don't
          read Cyrillic and translate it well, even transcribed to Western
          letters; it would take me quite some time to translate. But with some
          grit and patience, I believe I have unlocked some of the real Rasputin
          hiding in this mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most things regarding Raputin's life have been mythologized to a point
          where I believe most of us most likely consider some of these as
          facts. From death to birth, stories about Rasputin's life are repeated
          even by historians, like in this case, Dr. Dan Healey.
        </p>
        <p>
          "From the memoir of Maria Rasputin, Rasputin's daughter, she wrote
          that when he was born, there were other omens and portents things like
          a dog with six legs being born, babies with deformities, that kind of
          thing." - Dan Healey, Ph.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maria Rasputin has indeed written three memoirs. That is "<em
            >Rasputin: The Man Behind the Myth</em
          >," published in 1977. The second I've managed to track down is titled
          "<em>My Father</em>," published in 1934. And lastly, we have the first
          book, "The real Rasputin," published in 1929. None of these books
          mention these things Dr. Healy says, and it would be out of character
          for Maria to describe her father this way. In all these memoirs, she
          paints an almost saintly picture of her father, whom she seems to have
          loved. Reading these books, it becomes evident Healey was either
          mistaken or might have bought into the Rasputin mythos. The closest I
          get to some sort of miracle associated with Rasputin's birth is that
          Maria claims a comet was visible on the day of her father's birth. The
          issue with that claim is that she got the date and year wrong.
          According to the official records, Grigori Rasputin was born on
          January 9 and baptized on January 10, 1869.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Grigori was born in Pokrovskoe, a small village in the vast
          Siberian landscape. He was the first child of his parents, Yefim
          Rasputin and Anna Parshukova, to survive infancy. While the family had
          some money, it seems to have been tight. Yefim was at least once
          jailed for not paying his taxes. The sources seem split about Yefim;
          he was serving as an elder in the village church, and some have
          described him as learned, while others remark more on Yefim's fondness
          for Vodka.
        </p>
        <p>
          The family had been in Siberia since 1643, one year after the founding
          of Pokrovskoe village. An Izosim brought the family there, who then
          had no last name, and Izosim was only known as the son of Fyodor.
          Izosim's son, Nason, took Rospotin as his last name, which would later
          be spelled more modern as Rasputin. There are many strange tales about
          the name's origin, and few seem trustworthy. Rasputin was a quite
          common name in Siberia, and a possible source of it might be
          <em>rasputa</em>, a word that would be translated to crossroads in
          English.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early life of Rasputin was definitely shaped by Siberia; the land
          and its toils follow its people. Grigori helped his father with
          farmwork in the spring and summer while trying to shelter from the
          elements during the winter. Rasputin was illiterate until his
          adulthood, something that is far from surprising. According to an 1897
          census, his whole family was illiterate, and only some 20% of the
          population could read at this time. But very little is known about
          Grigori Rasputin's youth. This period of his life is a little bit of a
          black hole; as historian Douglas Smith put it, this has left room for
          some fanciful stories. My favorite depiction of the young Rasputin
          tells us, "<em
            >In his youth, Rasputin was uncommonly hapless. With a foul mouth,
            inarticulate speech, driveling, dirty as one can be, a thief, and a
            blasphemer, he was the fright of the village.</em
          >" The quote is from the<em> Petrograd Leaflet</em> in 1916. While
          accounts of Grigori Rasputin often depict him as a die-hard criminal
          and horse thief, this seems to be a bit of an exaggeration of the
          reality. A gendarme report from 1909 interviewed the people of
          Pokroskove and Rasputin, then is reported to have had various vices,
          liked getting drunk, and committed some minor theft. He then left and
          returned a changed man.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leaving part is also something that's often played as a big thing,
          but at the same time. Do you really need more reasons than living in
          the middle of Siberia in a small village? Rasputin told his acolytes
          about his early life, who documented it in "The Life of an experienced
          pilgrim." About why he left, he said:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >I had many sorrows, too: whatever misstake was made somewhere, I
            was blamed although I was not involved. Workmen from teams mocked
            me. I plowed hard and slept little and I kept asking my hearth how
            to find a way to be saved.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          There are several stories on why Rasputin left, and among the
          alternative historians, there's one in particular that's often
          repeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >One day while plowing his fields, Rasputin sees a strange light in
            the sky, and out from the middle of this light emerges a vision of
            the Virgin Mary. And she doesn't speak to him, but he watches her
            gesture to the horizon and Rasputin takes this to mean that he is
            being told by the Mother of God that he must go and find himself on
            a spiritual pilgrimage. And this begins the huge shift in Rasputin's
            life.</em
          >" - Kathleen McGowan Coppens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This account is from one edition of Maria Rasputin's memoirs. Grigori
          Rasputin also mentioned that he made the pilgrimage to atone for his
          sins or that it was commanded by Saint Simeon of Verkhoturye. Another
          reason could be his meeting with theology student Melity Zaborovsky.
          Others have claimed that the pilgrimage was undertaken to escape hard
          work or avoid punishment for crimes committed. Rasputin also gives us
          two years for when he embarked on the travel, either in 1893 or 1897.
          According to historian Douglas Smith, the later date that he gave to
          Father Yurevsky seems more likely. We know that Grigori Rasputin
          undertook the 500-kilometer journey from Pokrovskoe to the St. Nicolas
          monastery in Verkhoturye, which would change his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grigori Rasputin seems to have been quite the charismatic character,
          and shortly after his reformation and return to Pokrovskoe. Now, he
          started building a small following in the village, which would soon
          grow and expand as Rasputin continued his pilgrimages. The rumors
          would, of course, not stop, but they took a different style, accusing
          Rasputing of being part of a sect called Khlysty and engaging in,
          according to the morality of the time, lude acts with his followers.
          Khlysty was a heretic sect founded around 1640 in Russia when the
          Russian Orthodox Church started to crumble. Many fanciful stories
          surround this cult, that they would whip each other, engage in ritual
          orgies during worship and cannibalism. While the whipping part might
          be genuine, Khlyst means whip. The other claims lack credible evidence
          and are more likely to attempt to vilify the cult. I also want to
          point out that Khlysty might be a clever play on Kryiti or Christ in
          Russian.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Rasputin's growing influence, he met Tsar Nicholas in November
          1905, something that the tsar recorded in his diary. The royal couple
          liked Rasputin, and he often seemed to have visited them. Skeptical
          officials launched Investigations into Rasputin, but nothing turned up
          that would remove him from the capital. But it was not until 1912, and
          the so-called miracle in Spała, the tsar hunting grounds in today
          Poland, that Rasputin's reputation as a healer was cemented. Prince
          Alexi, who was suffering from hemophilia, developed a hematoma. It
          quickly got worse, and it's claimed that the prince was close to
          death. At this time, Queen Alexandra sent a telegram back to Rasputin
          in Russia, who answered quickly with a now-lost telegram. It's often
          claimed it goes as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The
            Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too
            much.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, it's claimed that Alexis made a miraculous recovery. Not
          to throw shade, but if you had the option of receiving medical help in
          the 1910s and not, you might want to opt for not. It was not uncommon
          to administer aspirin to hemophiliacs. As you might know, aspirin is
          blood thinning and is not recommended to give to someone whose blood
          doesn't clot. So it's suggested that this advice is basically what
          saved the prince.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's fast forward to 1916 and the death of Rasputin. An end that is
          not to anyone's surprise is surrounded by speculation and rumors.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Rasputin wrote an open letter to Russia. And within this open
            letter, he states, "If I am murdered by the royal family or by
            someone related to the royal family, 'within two years every member
            of the royal family will be dead.</em
          >'" - Kathleen McGowan Coppens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This claim's origin is from Aron Simanowich, and from the evidence we
          have, this seems to be made up. Simanowich, however, never claimed it
          was an open letter but a letter to Rasputin's lawyer to be added to
          his testament. Aron Simanowich might have been inspired by a letter
          Rasputin sent his family. In it, Rasputin claimed that disaster and
          misfortune were coming. Not really a prediction at the end of 1916,
          two years into World War 1, and the February Revolution would start on
          the 8th of Mars. No, the Russians were not late to their own
          revolution, but they used the Julian calendar still at this time. In
          this letter, there are no claims from Rasputin on his death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The commonly told story of Rasputin's death is that Rasputin was
          invited to Prince Yussupoff's palace on 94 Moika. That part is not
          really debated, but what happened after. According to Yussupoff,
          Rasputin was taken in through the side passage of the palace and down
          into the cellar, where they had tea. There, Rasputin was offered cakes
          laced with cyanide; while declining the cakes at first, Griegory then
          ate several of them. Since the poison did not work, Yussupoff offered
          some sweet wine with some potassium cyanide. When the wine didn't work
          either, Rasputin started to become agitated. Yussupoff then ended up
          shooting Rasputin in the chest with a revolver. Yussupoff's
          accomplices heard the shot and came down and declared Rasputin dead,
          and they set their other plan in motion, pretending to drive Rasputin
          home. But in the meantime, Rasputin is claimed to have come back to
          life shouting like a wounded animal and behaving like a demon he is
          trying to escape. The assassins hear this and follow with guns,
          shooting Rasputin several more times and throwing him into the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          What really happened on that night is hard to tell. It does not make
          it easier that people involved in the plot have later suggested that
          parts of the story can't be true. For example, Yussupoff claims to
          have gotten the potassium cyanide from Vasily Maklakov, a later
          ambassador. Maklakov claims to have only given some harmless powder.
          But even if poison was obtained, the one lazing the cakes, Doctor
          Stanislav Lazovert, changed his mind at the last second and did not
          want to break his Hippocratic oath. Lazovert might have used aspirin
          instead. The autopsy could only confirm the gunshot to the head as the
          cause of death. No sign of drowning or poison seemed to have been
          visible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maria Rasputin also claims in her memoirs that her father didn't enjoy
          sweets, so the poison part would be out of the question. While we
          might not be able to fully confirm the story, I think it's important
          to note that it primarily builds on Yussupoff's claims. He wanted to
          eliminate Rasputin due to his influence over the tsar. So, using the
          rumors surrounding the religious man, he tried to portray him as
          someone in league with the devil. A satan incarnated set out to
          destroy Russia. It's important to remember that tales can come with an
          agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, nationalists have picked up the story and reversed it.
          In it, Yussupoff is portrayed as a decadent bisexual who has been
          influenced to become a secular Westerner. Yussupoff is then trying to
          kill the protector of Russia, Rasputin, who gets some protection due
          to his true Orthodox belief in the one almighty God.
        </p>
        <p>
          The alien proponents, in turn, claim that Rasputin possessed or
          channeled the alien beings, which protected him and gave him all these
          powers. Tying their segments back to the idea that extra-terrestrial
          beings can take over a person and make them do evil things. Again,
          this adds to the stigma around mental health in this. While Rasputin
          was not mentally ill, the Ancient Alien people still wanted to make
          this type of connection. In the end, Rasputin was not an evil magician
          who tried to take over Russia but a convenient scapegoat during
          turbulence.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I find the connection that the show tries to make that Rasputin
          was possessed by evil aliens quite harmful. It does tie into the idea
          of stigmatization we talked about in the first part of the show. And
          out of the oven and into the fire, we travel to Nazi Germany for this
          last part, after these few messages.
        </p>
        <h2 id="blacksun">The Black Sun of Wewelsburg</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the Renaissance castle Wewelsburg outside a small village
          in Germany. We have been here previously in our episode
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-19-aliens-third-reich.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Aliens and the Third Reich</em></a
          >, but it seems to be time to revisit the site. The castle that was
          built in 1603 was acquired by Himmler in November of 1933, who wanted
          to expand the palace to become a cult place for his ariosophic ideas.
          One symbol in the castle has been the center of many theories and
          speculations. Mike Fitzgerald describes the Black Sun symbol like
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Wewelsburg Castle was acquired in 1933 by Himmler. He intended to
            make that the spiritual center of the world. The Black Sun symbol
            symbolized an invisible sun or a dead sun, and consequently it was
            believed that there was hidden power that resided in that, that
            could be tapped, that would link you into a completely different
            source of energies from the ordinary ones that you would get.</em
          >" - Mike Fitzgerald.
        </p>
        <p>
          In what was formerly known as the SS Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Hal,
          located on the first floor, we can find a round room with twelve
          pillars, a type of sun symbol with twelve spokes created from tiles.
          Each spoke almost like a sig rune connected in the center in what
          could be a shield. There have been speculations that this symbol might
          have taken inspiration from older sources. While it's often suggested
          to be a Norse symbol, it is not. What we know today as the Black Sun
          seems to be modeled after French disks with a similar design. We find
          these in graves, especially women, as disks that have been part of a
          belt or brooch for tunics during the Merovingian period in France.
          While there are older examples from the Bronze Age, the ones we find
          during the 5th-8th centuries and early Middle Ages are more analogous
          to what we see at Wewelsburg.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why did Himmler add this symbol to the floor of this castle? As
          usual, we can thank our three usual suspects within Nazi symbolism,
          Guido von List, William Landig, and Helena Blavatsky. In her most
          influential work, <em>The Secret Doctrine</em> from 1888, Blavatsky
          describes "<em
            >a point unseen and mysterious, the ever-hidden center of attraction
            of our Sun and system.</em
          >" With this, she makes a distinction between Semitic and Aryan
          cosmology. An idea that was picked up by the
          <em>v&ouml;lkish</em> movement in Germany. Guido von List often talked
          about a "primal fire." But the most influence over the Black Sun as a
          modern Neo-nazi idea could be credited to Wilhelm Landig. A former SS
          member and occultist who, in large, preserved the idea of Ariosophy
          and introduced it to the later generations of Nazis. Landig wrote the
          Thule trilogy to attract younger people to the esoteric nazism he
          promoted. In this fantasy for right-wing radicals, former SS officers
          are heroes fighting a Jewish conspiracy. He mixes Atlantis and the
          origin of Aryans with the neo-nationalistic mythos of hidden nazi UFO
          bases in Antarctica, Nazi-Tibet connections with ancient masters,
          grail mythos, and alchemy.

          It makes sense that Himmler would have found this concept about the
          esoteric light fascinating and, most likely, why this symbol is found
          where it is. Himmler is one of the few top Nazi officials who were
          active in the esoteric movement during Nazi Germany. But something
          worth noting here is that the Nazi Germans did not have a concept
          referred to as the Black Sun or Schwarze Sonne, the symbol we find in
          Wewelsburg was only referred to as a <em>Sonnenrad</em> or sun wheel.
          SS officer and folklorist Bernhard Frank, who spent time at the castle
          around 1935, had never heard of the term Black Sun being used to
          reference the sun wheel. He claims that this is a postwar idea. This
          claim seems to be correct. The first connection made between the
          concept of the Black Sun and the sun wheel at Wewelsburg is in the
          book "<em>The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo</em>" (Die Schwarze Sonne von
          Tashi Lhunpo) by author Russell McCloud, released in 1991. In the
          book, McCloud links the sun wheel to the esoteric myths of Karl Maria
          Wiligut and Guido von List. The book is an occult-Nazi thriller that
          utilizes the nazi mythos about Tibet, Thule, and Mongolia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Nazi Mythos incorporated Blavatsky's ideas about Shambhala, a
          concept she borrowed from Tibetan Buddhism. Within this branch of
          Buddhism, Shambhala is a spiritual kingdom. Within Theosophy, this
          spiritual kingdom became an invisible land where the hidden masters
          who spoke to the theosophic prophets resided. The Nazis also added the
          idea of Agarttha to their legends, an invention by Alexandre
          Saint-Yves d'Alveydre. It was claimed that Alexandre was visited by
          higher masters in 1885 from Agarttha, a part of a hollow earth. In the
          past, they had been a part of a world government that, around 3200
          BCE, had been transferred to reside within the Hollow Earth. One of
          the entrances to the invisible earth and Agarttha could be found in
          Mongolia.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this became part of McCloud's story that would come to heavily
          influence the Neo-Nazi movement in the 90's. Since then, the Black Sun
          of Wewelsburg has become a key symbol among Neo-Nazis and is today one
          of the most frequent symbols you might encounter. But as we see here,
          the symbol is not connected to the Vikings or symbology used within
          the Scandinavian Viking societies. So, the Black Suns with Norse runes
          around are very anachronistic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also while Fitzgerald is correct regarding the idea of an invisible
          sun as part of the esoteric legacy of Nazi mystics. He, like many
          others, gets the connection between the idea and symbol wrong, as we
          see here. I also want, as in our Nazi episode, to bring up the
          problematic aspect of connecting the horrible ideas and crimes of Nazi
          Germany with aliens. As we saw back in episode 19, they alluded to
          that the Germans did what they did, not due to cultish following, bad
          people, and a horrible view of people, but due to alien influence.
          These claims take away some of the individual autonomy and shift the
          blame from the nazis to aliens. I also find it highly problematic that
          they allude to the mental illness and crimes of people in Germany
          during the Nazi regime. While what Ancient Aliens do is not really
          holocaust denialism, it's darn close, to be honest, and does add to
          the misinformation about the cause and ideas of nazism. As we have
          seen in the past, Ancient Aliens are not beyond directly quoting and
          using neo-nazi writers as sources in their material.
        </p>
        <p>
          On that bombshell, I'll close out this episode. While we did not talk
          that much about archaeology, I think we had an exciting discussion and
          probably managed to remove some misguided ideas we might have had.
