          In this episode, we continue to look into Graham Hancock's new Netflix
          show, Ancient Apocalypse. Join Fredrik, who uses his background in
          archaeology and a bit of skepticism to look deeper into the claims
          presented in the show. Is Hancock on to something we missed, or are
          there better explanations?
        </p>
        <p>
          In part one, we learned about Graham Hancock's origin and inspiration.
          This time we use this knowledge to look into the claims presented in
          the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will first visit Gunung Padang, a site some claim was constructed
          in 20 000 BCE and is the world's largest pyramid. Next, we go to
          Cholula, the largest accepted pyramid, and investigate claims that
          giants constructed it. Lastly, we travel to Malta, home to some of the
          oldest megalithic temples, and explore the Sirius connection.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the Netflix show Ancient Apocalypse
          temporarily. Do the claims hold water to an archeologist or are there
          better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 31. So in the last
          episode, we looked at the origin of Hancock's claim and came to
          realize that it&rsquo;s mostly an esoteric approach he has toward the
          sources. This time we will focus a little bit more on the historical
          sites he brings up.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also have with us dr. Bill Farley and Kayleigh from
          &ldquo;History with Kayleigh.&rdquo; The sites we visit are Gunung
          Padang, Cholula, and Malta. You&rsquo;re in for a real treat this
          time, and we really get down and dirty with most of the claims from
          the first three episodes. I also want to thank
          <a href="https://twitter.com/Majora__Z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >@majoraZ</a
          >, who kindly shared their research on Cholula and some of the myths
          about the site.

          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="GunungPadang">Gunung Padang</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start where Hancock starts the show, with Gunung Padang. This
          site is located in west Java, some three and a half hours from the
          central city of Jakarta. Hancock claims this site is a mystery and has
          to be solved. A puzzle indeed we have, but not the one Graham might
          have intended.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a rich tradition of legends in the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Archipelago"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Malay Archipelago</a
          >, as in many other places. Of course, there are legends about Gunung
          Padang. For example, the Sundanese people tell stories about how
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Siliwangi"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >King Siliwangi</a
          >
          tried to build a palace here in a single night (Perez Garcia, 2017).
          While Hancock usually sees things from a mythical lens, we don't see
          much of it here. Or do we? His primary theory in this section is that
          there once was a vast and powerful civilization before the deluge in
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundaland"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Sundaland</em></a
          >. Now did he come up with this idea by himself? Well, as we
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-30-ancient-apocalypse-1.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >learned in the first part</a
          >, Hancock is heavily inspired by theosophic writings. So is it a big
          surprise that theosophist
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Webster_Leadbeater"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >C.W. Leadbeater</a
          >
          wrote in his book "<em>The Occult History Of Java</em>" that Java was
          an Atlantean colony still attached to the Asian mainland (Leadbeater,
          1951)? Just because an idea is presented in an esoteric book does not
          mean it's necessarily wrong.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's see what Hancock claims about this site and what evidence
          there is. There are three claims we see in the show. That Gunung
          Padang is a pyramid, that it is human-made, and C-14 datings show the
          site's construction could be 9600 BCE or maybe even 20 000 BCE.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with the first idea that Gunung Padang is an intentional
          human-made pyramid. Since the rediscovery in 1979 (Sulistyowati and
          Foe, 2021), excavations have taken place ever since. A couple of
          hypotheses have been tested, and since no grave has been discovered
          within the complex, it's usually agreed that this is a "<a
            href="https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punden_berundak"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>punden berundak</em></a
          >." This would make sense since this type of structure is found across
          west Java. Punden Berundak is a megalithic structure whose name
          translates to "Glorified person" (Pageh and Pardi, 2021). These
          structures are similar to a step pyramid in the sense that they are
          pyramid formed and have different platforms. But they are used as a
          part of ancestral worship (Pageh and Pardi, 2021; Perez Garcia, 2017).
          This tradition was most active with megalithic sites during the
          Paleometallic Period, sometimes referred to as the Indo-
        </p>
        <p>
          Malayan Bronze-Iron Age (Perez Garcia, 2017). This period is usually
          set to be around 500 BCE to 500 AD. So Gunung Padang is one of many
          structures with this shape in the area, but the largest due to the
          incorporation of the 885-meter tall natural hill. You also have Lebak
          Sibedug, Arca Domas, Bukit Kasur, and many more megalithic structures
          in the same type of tradition (Perez Garcia, 2017). We also see
          connections in later Samoan traditions of mound building around 1100
          CE (Wallin, Martinsson-Wallin, and Clark 2007). Before we go further,
          and it will become clear later why I bring this up, the
          <em>punden berundak</em> theory is entangled with regional
          superiority.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the manufactured part is only at the top of the hill. We find five
          enclosures where archaeologists would agree we see artificial
          structures (Bradley, 2016; Perez Garcia, 2017). But the rest of the
          hill is a natural phenomenon. Since the base is a volcano (Bachelard,
          2013), the we see in the episode would not have needed to be brought
          in. Hancock makes a point that columnar joints are "<em
            >normally vertical</em
          >." While there are many examples where columnar joints are vertical,
          look at devil's causeway, and you see that. But there are many other
          examples where it's not. The cracks that create the columns appear
          where the lava flows cool (Bentley, 2011). We see this in the supposed
          retainer wall we see in the show. What Hancock and the geologist Dr.
          Hilman refer to as mortar is, according to vulcanologists, traces of
          natural weathering (Bachelard, 2013). That this is a volcano also
          explains the "cave" Dr. Hilman claim to be artificial. From all the
          evidence, it looks to be a natural lava tunnel.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we can agree with Hancock here that the site is artificial. But
          it's not a pyramid and has never been intended to be a pyramid. The
          constructors also used locally available stones to construct this
          punden berundak. So that we don't know its function or refuse to
          accept it's manufactured is a rather strange claim from Hancock. But
          note that this hill is an ancient volcano, and the stones we see are
          usually found in the necks of the vulcanos that this site is a part of
          (Perez Garcia, 2017).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now for the dates, and of course, things start to take a darker turn
          here. Much of the episode is spent with the geologist Dr. Danny Hilman
          Natawidjaja. He was, together with lead archaeologist Ali Akbar
          responsible for an excavation that took place here between 2011 and
          2014. Both appear throughout this episode as experts, but this
          excavation has not been without criticism. And to understand the C14
          dating, we need to look closely at how they excavated the site.&nbsp;
        </p>

          We should pause and reflect every time we notice archaeology is used
          for political gain. First, we should note that Indonesia is a
          post-colonial state. While the first president Soekarna was trying to
          build a nation based on economic freedom from the west (Sulistyowati
          and Foe, 2021), empires from the pre-colonial past were used to
          strengthen the legacy of his regime. That archaeology has been used to
          support nationalistic ideas (D&iacute;az-Andreu and Champion, 2014) is
          far from new. Neither is sponsoring a pseudo-archaeological claim to
          boost your national image. We also saw this in<a

          >
          pyramids in Visoko (Trusohamn, 2022). We see another similarity with
          the Bosnian pyramids, funding going to investigate fringe ideas (Dipa,
          2014; Trusohamn, 2022). The research team at Gunung Padang received 3
          billion Rupiah (Dipa, 2014) in initial funding. Compare this to the
          4,6 billion Rupah Bandung Archaeological Center to cover research and
          salaries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no secret that the excavation of Gunung Padang was ordered by
          the then-sitting president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (Dipa, 2014;
          Sulistyowati and Foe, 2021). As Sulistyowati and Foe (2021) wrote, the
          Yudhoyono administration utilized symbols and landmarks to try and
          bolster the national identity. Yudhoyono wanted a symbol that could be
          considered older and bigger than famous monuments like the pyramids of
          Giza. We also see nationalistic activities take place during the
          excavations. There was a flag raising, salutes, high ranking
          officials, and they named the dig "Operation to Honor Red and White."
        </p>
        <p>
          But even if an excavation has a political agenda, they can still do
          good research. So is this the case here? The more we look at this, the
          more it becomes clear that this was not the case. They went for a
          rather destructive excavation with a lack of general oversight and
          methodology (Dipa, 2014; Perez Garcia, 2017; Sulistyowati and Foe,
          2021). Samples were taken and analyzed without motivating relevance or
          context. There are cases of more recent items contaminating the
          excavation. For example, a coin that turned out to be from about
          mid-1900 (Perez Garcia, 2017; Bradley 2017a) was dated by the
          excavation team to be from a layer they dated to 5200 BC. The find was
          not in-situ, and there was never any good reason for placing it in
          that layer. They didn't talk with other archaeologists or numismatics
          but decided it was an ancient amulet and evidence of this ancient
          culture's achievements.&nbsp;

        <p>
          There are more reports of items not found in situ, which would be
          expected when the project sometimes had up to 500 volunteers. Their
          experience with archaeology is unknown, but there are cases where
          military personnel excavated with hoes to get down quicker (Dipa,
          2014; Sulistyowati and Foe, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the C-14 datings, they have a similar pattern of mistakes.
          There are, for example, two core drillings from Dr. Hillman
          Natawidjaja. We're only sure where one of those cores was taken
          (Bradley, 2017a), creating a context issue. The dates look strange;
          there are some issues with older and younger material in different
          places in the core. The 20 000 BCE date thrown around in the show is
          from drill core two at a depth of seven meters. We get a calibrated
          date of 11 600 BCE at eight meters, and the sequence is closed out on
          another 20 000 BCE date (Hillman et al., 2018). I'd also like to note
          that some of these extreme dates are separated in the perceived layers
          by a couple of centimeters. While that might be plausible, it's highly
          peculiar and not something Hillman acknowledges in the scarce
          documentation we have. As for the mixed sequence, this type of
          contamination could happen. We previously mentioned that core drilling
          is sensitive to contamination (Henriksen, Holst, and Breuning-Madsen,
          2019).

        <p>
          Furthermore, the researchers didn't know what they were testing.
          Context is everything in archaeology. We need to know what we're
          testing and in what context. But the team seems to have tested
          "organic matter" they decided is from activity during the construction
          (Bradley, 2017b). But since Hillman Natawidjaja's and Ali Akbar's
          teams have rounded the quality control that is peer review, the data
          we have is scarce. They have systematically only spoken with news and
          media outlets instead of publishing in journals (Sulistyowati and Foe,
          2021).&nbsp;
        </p>

          Add to this a lack of attention to stratigraphy, an insufficiency of
          documentation when removing the columnar joints, and the general site
          destruction (Perez Garcia, 2017; Sulistyowati and Foe, 2021), we have
          parts of the site that are somewhat useless for a future scientist.
          This is an excellent example of what happens when politics and an
          agenda try to mascarade as science. Hillman Natawidjaja went into the
          site to find evidence for his idea, and the Yudhoyono regime paid for
          a nationalistic monument. It becomes pretty evident in Hillman's book
          "<em>Plato never lied: Atlantis is in Indonesia</em>" from 2013 that
          he was out to prove his idea. Evidence that might disprove his
          hypotheses is left out or explained away.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I find it almost a little bit unseemly when Hancock uses these
          dates without context to prove his hypothesis. In the episode, they
          never mention the excavations or the obscene amount of money they got.
          Instead, he goes for the idea that the discovery is getting silenced.
          But it's not silenced because scientists have yet to see the data. But
          this approach fits Hancock since it gives a chance to claim that
          archaeologists refuse to look at the evidence. But then leaving out
          all the issues archaeologists have pointed out.

          and having the largest pyramid on earth. Welcome to Cholula, located
          in Puebla, Mexico. This might not be the tallest pyramid in the world,
          measuring some 25 meters (82 ft) in height, but by volume, it's the
          grandest. The sides measured 315 by 300 meters (1033 x 984 ft) and
          were built around the late pre-classic period, almost simultaneous to
          the Teotihuacan building. We can see the influences of this larger
          city on the Cholula pyramid in the earlier stages. They use, for
          example, the architectural style

          Hancock's dating is not too strange, while his date of 500 BCE is a
          bit off, and he does not offer any reason for the date. Usually, the
          pyramid's original date is placed between 400 BCE to 200 BCE. But the
          200 BCE date is more likely since it's based on ceramics found at the
          site (Coe and Koontz, 2013; Feagans, 2022b). Graham spends most of the
          time walking around the tunnels beneath the pyramid. But they bring up
          a small spring. Hancock claims it's beneath the Cholula pyramid but,
          in reality, is a bit more to the west. This natural spring feeds into
          a marshy area that's a bit recessed. If you have been with us for some
          time or are well-read on Maya mythology, you might recognize this
          scene from the creation myth. We have what could be described as a
          ceremonial ball court from where the maize god sprung. Water is an
          essential part of the Maya rituals (Lucero, 2006), as we discussed in
          an earlier&nbsp; episode. So it's not strange that they build a
          pyramid temple close to a water source.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We should note here that Hancock wishes to see something more than the
          shape of the building tying the world's pyramids together. There's
          little more than the shape that they have in common. Hancock said,
          "<em
            >The problem is that these structures are universally associated
            with very specific spiritual ideas. What happens to us after
            death?</em
          >" In Graham Hancocks' mind, all the pyramids of the world have a
          common idea, death and the afterlife. And since they all share this
          idea, it's impossible that these structures developed independently.
          But there's an issue with Hancock's reasoning; the pyramids aren't all
          connected to death or the afterlife. Sure, the Egyptian pyramids were
          tombs, and others were or are part of the religion. Sure, religion
          tends to claim to have the answers to what happens when we die, but
          that's as close as it gets. The pyramids in Mesoamerica were more
          connected to life. The pyramid of the Sun in Teotihuacan commemorates
          the creation (Porter Weaver, 2019). The sacrifices were to ensure the
          continuation of life (Almere Read and Gonzalez, 2001). The mounds of
          North America were filling several different functions ranging from
          ceremonial, locations for longhouses, meeting places, etc. It's not
          correct to attribute them to life after death. We have temples in
          India and Cambodia that have a religious connection but not dying or
          the afterlife. Then we have the pyramids in China that are tombs
          again. What Graham Hancock does here is cherry-pick data that fits his
          narrative. The same thing he accuses archaeologists of doing, funny,
          isn't it?&nbsp;

        <p>
          But let's move into Hancock's favorite pastime, looking at myth from
          an esoteric lens. You see, there is a legend that giants built the
          pyramid of Cholula after seven of them survived a great deluge. The
          first and kind of only account of this story are written in a book
          called Ophiolatreia published in 1899. In it, the anonymous author
          retells a report from a nameless Dominican priest who visited Cholula
          in 1566 (Ophiolatreia, 1899; p.64). This story show sign of Christian
          influence, something not uncommon when they in the past retold pagan
          myth. Snorre Sturlasson's poetic edda does the same with the nordic
          pagan myths. We must remember that objectively writing down scholarly
          material is a relatively fresh idea. Even if giants appear in
          mesoamerican creation stories (Almere Read and Gonzalez, 2001; Murphy,
          2015), they differ wildly from what we were presented here. Also,
          while some early creations were destroyed by a flood, others were
          destroyed by dogs (Almere Read and Gonzalez, 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to evaluate myths critically; some might hold good
          information. Lipo, Hunts, and Hoa's (2013) recreation of how the Moai
          status could have been moved is based on legends but viewed from a
          critical lens. So archaeologists do use legends, but with a more
          objective approach.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that should be addressed before we move on to our last stop
          for this episode I want again to bring up the idea of Kukulkan or
          Quetzalcoatl. At least Hancock in the series does not claim
          Quetzalcoatl to be white (1995) any longer, but he still has this idea
          that this god came from the east. Within mesoamerican mythology,
          Quetzalcoatl has two sides, one part creator/destroyer of the universe
          and one part cultural hero (Almere Read and Gonzalez, 2001). But
          Graham seems to confuse the hero part of the story with the god part.
          Quetzalcoatl as a cultural hero is confusing since it talks about a
          ruler sometimes referred to as 1-Reed or Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl. The
          end of 1-Reed varies depending on the version and when it was told. In
          some, he sailed east or west, burned himself up, became the morning
          star, moved to Tlilapan, became sick, and just died or split the ocean
          as Moses (Almere Read and Gonzalez, 2001; Murphy, 2015). Again we have
          captured Hancock in his orchard of cherry trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of Quetzalcoatl being white is an invention of
          Ger&oacute;nimo (Jer&oacute;nimo) de Mendieta, a Franciscan missionary
          and chronicler who lived between 1525&ndash;1604. In his work
          "Historia eclesi&aacute;stica indiana" volume two, chapter 10 (2.10),
          we learn about some of the histories of Quetzalcoatl. De Mendieta
          probably based this on the now-lost writings of Andr&eacute;s de
          Olmos, another priest operating a bit earlier than de Mendieta. But in
          this chapter, we learn that Quetzalcoatl (or Kukulkan) was described
          as follows (translated by the author).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "He was a white man, tall in body, broad forehead, large eyes, long
          black hair, and large round beard." / "Era hombre blanco, crecido de
          cuerpo, ancha la frente, los ojos grandes, los cabellos largos y
          negros, la barba grande y redonda"
        </p>
        <h2 id="Malta">Malta</h2>
        <p>
          Let's head east from Mesoamerica over to the Mediterranian sea. Just
          south of Sicily, we find three islands: Gozo, Comino, and Malta. This
          little island nation is home to some of the oldest known megalithic
          structures. We covered these buildings recently in an episode called
          "<a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-29-aliens-and-ancient-engineers.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Aliens and ancient engineers</em></a
          >," and what's interesting is that Hancock's claims do not differ much
          from this old Ancient Alien episode. We still have the idea that an
          outside force came to the island and helped the "farmers who never
          built anything bigger than a shack." The funny thing is that the
          Ancient Alien proponents agree with the "mainstream" interpretation of
          the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not Graham Hancock; he disagrees with the conventional date
          between 3600 BCE and 3200 BCE. He admits that there are datable
          artifacts within the ruins that make these dates possible, but they
          are handwaved away since that part was built later, of course. The
          director of this show does a great job of giving the impression that
          these sites are barely investigated. But there's ample dating of these
          temples. There's both Optically Stimulated Luminescence testing; we
          test quartz to see when it was subjected to sunlight. These dates come
          up again to be about 3600 BCE to 3080 BCE (Malone et al. 2020). Add to
          this Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, a form of radiocarbon dating that
          has given us dates between 3600 BCE and 3200 BCE (Trump [not that
          one], 2001).
        </p>
        <p>
          But the date Hancock want is around 10 000 BCE, so he has set out to
          find someone who agrees with him. Hancock does this little sneaky
          thing again here, claiming that we will use archeoastronomy, which is
          a real thing. Or, as Graham calls it, "the knowledge of the ancients."
          In reality, it's not archeoastronomy we'll use since it would not fit
          with the theory. Instead, they interview a Dutch juridical translator
          by the name of Lenie Reedijk.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reedijk believes that all the temples on Malta align with the
          brightest star Sirius. To get this theory to work, the construction
          time of the temples needed to be pushed back to 9000 BCE. According to
          Hancock and Reedijk, at least. The reason for selecting this date is
          unclear since Sirus would be visible about 5350 BCE or 4250 BCE
          (Bratt, 2022). You could also orient the temples toward Centauri, the
          equinoxes, or solstices. Why these orientations are not viable is
          never explained or even presented. They also leave out that the
          southern cross lines up a lot better with all the temples on Malta
          (Bratt, 2022). In contradiction to the Sirius alignment, that would
          only work with some of the temples even if the dates are moved back
          (Bratt, 2022). The southern cross, or the crux, would make more sense
          for the Maltese sailors navigating to and from Sicily. Using the crux
          as an alignment also fit's within the timeframe we have from the
          extensive dating.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there's an ace in the arm; Hancock has evidence of earlier
          human habitation. Or, well, human-like habitation. In the cave of Għar
          Dalam, two teeth were found in 1917 by Mr. G. Despott (Neanderthal Man
          in Malta, 1924) and identified as Neanderthal. It was based on the
          teeth' perceived pulp chambers (or taurodontism) (Kieth, 1924). But
          this identification has never been replicated, and it seems like it
          was wrong from the start (Boulinier, 2004). This does not mean that
          it's impossible that Neanderthals lived on Malta; we don't have any
          evidence for it. Plausible, yes, proven? No, not yet, but maybe one
          day in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll gloss over the cart ruts here since I went into greater detail in
          an earlier episode on their origin. As the researcher stands now, they
          are most likely marks from carts hollowed out by erosion (Groucutt,
          2022).&nbsp;

          Hancock comes up with quite an interesting remark in the show to get a
          connection between Malta, Ancient Egypt, and Osiris. He claims that
          the boats on Malta have an eye on Hourus on them. Some look like this
          on modern vessels, but the tradition does not originate from Egypt. It
          originated from Greece and Rome (Novak, 2006) and was to ward off envy
          and harm. Concepts well known in Greek and Roman literature. So
          Hancocks Osiris connection topples over like a cow in the night.

        <p>To close out the show, I want to introduce our next guest.</p>
        <p>
          Thanks again, Kayleigh; links to her projects can be found in the show
          notes. But we will close the books for now, but make sure to return
          next time. The exploration will take us to G&ouml;bekli Tepe, Poverty
          Point, Serpent Mound, and back to Derinkuyu. We will also be guested
          by dr Kinkella from the pseudoarchaeology podcast. So make sure you
          tune in again back then.

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.
