          Netflix's new documentary Ancient Apocalypse was on top of the charts
          for quite some time. The show is hosted by Graham Hancock, a writer
          who has written several books regarding his theory of a lost stone age
          civilization. The series is based on Hancock's books "Magicians of the
          Gods" and "America before."
        </p>
        <p>
          But how well do Hancock's claims hold up when examined? In this
          episode, Fredrik, with his background in archaeology, looks into the
          origins of the theories of Hancock. We will learn more about what he
          is about and where these ideas originated. This journey will be
          through esoterism, Blavatskian Theosophy, philosophy, and
          archaeological methods.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We're also joined by Dr. Jeb Card and Brian Dunning, who shares their
          knowledge about these ideas.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Card is an Assistant Teaching Professor at Miami University and a
          pre-Hispanic Maya political history specialist. He has also been
          dealing with pseudoscience for a long time. Dr. Card has written

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we usually examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. But
          today, we&rsquo;re going to switch out one world and examine Ancient
          Apocalypse. Do the claims hold water to an archaeologist or are there
          better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 30. As you just heard,
          we&rsquo;re going out on a little detour again. Last time we
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-11-3-creepy-cases-ancient-aliens.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >reacted to Buzzfeed</a
          >'s unsolved but this time, we&rsquo;re going after something a little
          bit bigger. Netflix semi new show Ancient Apocalypse, hosted by Graham
          Hancock and largely based on his books
          <em>Magicians of the Gods</em> and <em>America before</em>. What
          we&rsquo;re about to embark on is a breakdown of the series in three
          parts. This means that we&rsquo;re not going to dissect the series in
          nitty-gritty detail. Instead, we will have a different approach.
          Several others have already gone into greater detail, breaking down
          each episode. So I&rsquo;ll focus a little bit more on what I believe
          they might have missed. We also have brought up almost every site
          Hancock is visiting already, but with the claim, it was aliens behind
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also have a couple of guests who will share some great
          insights we can use when watching this show or confronting these types
          of more dubious historical claims. At first, I contemplated inviting
          Graham Hancock, but he does have access to quite large platforms
          already. Why offer more? But if you want to come on as a guest,
          Graham, you&rsquo;re welcome to. Just have your people contact me, and
          we can set something up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          A comet is tumbling down through the atmosphere. But the people
          witnessing this do not know it by this name. In later tellings, they
          would refer to this as the serpent in the sky; others called it a
          dragon or the Evil One. At 50 000 kilometers an hour, the large cometh
          crashed into the ground. If there were some close by, they suddenly
          were no more. Those further away would feel the ground shaking as if
          the earth itself trembled in fear of what was to come. Those furthest
          away only felt a slight shiver, but the omen in the sky had already
          told them something was coming. For some time, everything was still,
          but it would change quickly as the water rose. One of the greatest
          civilizations we had seen until then was promptly lost, except for a
          few people who managed to survive. These people took it upon
          themselves to wander the earth, sharing a warning of coming danger and
          teaching others the lost technologies and knowledge.

          This story might be familiar to you if you have watched the show
          Ancient Apocalypse or read Graham Hancock's books. But it's not from
          Hancock's books; I got this based on the book "<a

            rel="noopener"
            >Ignatius Donnelly</a
          >. We will get back to Donnelly later, but I'm bringing this up to
          explain that the ideas in Ancient Apocalypse are not new. They have
          been around since at least the turn of the last century, and to
          contend with these ideas, we need to understand their origin. To ease
          us into this first part of the exploration, I like to welcome our
          first guest.

            >Dr. Ken Feder</a
          >, according to alternative history theorists, archaeologists and
          historians constantly lose civilizations (Feder, 2020). I would argue
          that losing track of an abandoned site is natural, but what
          differentiates a lost real site from a made-up one is that we find the
          real ones sooner or later. We also uncover them where they logically
          would be. Take, for example, the most known example, Troy. Heinrich
          Schliemann is attributed as the discoverer in 1873, but people had
          suggested the site of Hisarlik since at least 1822 (Card, 2019b). To
          be honest, Schliemann probably did the place a considerable
          disservice. It has been discovered that he faked a couple of finds,
          such as Priam's Treasure and a led figurine with a swastika scratched
          into it. Another place lost and found is the town of Truso, described
          by
          <a
            href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000114863"

            rel="noopener"
            >Wulfstan </a
          >(Jagodziński, 2009). However, again, we found it on the shore of Lake
          Druzno, where we expected it to be. Note that both these locations
          were quickly found when people started to look.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          Compare this to the more fabled civilizations of Lemuria, Mu, and well
          Atlantis. Or
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-23-the-hunt-for-eldorado.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >El Dorado</a
          >, the lost city of Z, and many other places. The mother of most of
          these legends is the story of Atlantis (Feder, 2020), originating as a
          rhetorical device by Plato. While this fabled city only gets a small
          role in the Ancient Apocalypse series, Hancock's ideas would not be
          much without it. To truly understand the hypothesis Graham present, we
          need to understand Atlantis and what this legend birthed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock claims in the show that "<em

          was born in 429 or 428 BCE. This date isn't too important, but when he
          was 18 or 19, he became a student of the famous Socrates. While
          Socrates never bothered to write something down (Feder, 2020), he was
          fortunate to have such an ambitious pupil as Plato. As we know, Plato,
          just as Cher and Prince went by his mononym and was a star in his
          time. I've no idea why I went with these examples,

          Plato is also known for using dialogs to teach, but they were never
          intended to be taken as records from a real conversation. These
          dialogs usually include his old teacher, friends, and other real
          people (de Camp, 1975). They were intended to be literary devices to
          represent Platos' ideas.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Plato describes Atlantis in two works,

            >Critias</a

          book called Hermocrates (Jordan, 2001). These books were to elaborate
          on Platons "<a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Republic</a
          >," even taking place the night after this discussion in 421 BCE.
          Plato was about eight years old at the time, so he was probably not
          there. The books were written around 355 BCE, putting Plato in his
          70's (Jordan, 2001).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If we read Timeaus, we learn that Socrates wants to continue
          discussing the perfect society. While we today might see Socrates'
          ideal as rather fascist, nonetheless, he gives his pupils the task of
          describing an ideal society and how it would perform against Athens.
          Hermocles proceeds to throw Critias under the bus by volunteering him
          to Socrates. Most presumably steaming of fury and planning his revenge
          Hermocles Critias go on and tells a story told to him by his
          grandfather. The grandfather had first conveyed this story during a
          festival called
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >Apaturia</a
          >, during which young chaps could win prizes for their literary
          inventions. But it was not Critias the older (the grandfather is, of
          course, named Critias too) who first told the story. No, that would
          have been his father, Dropides. Of course, this is not the source
          either. That was a Greek sage named Solon, who had heard it from a
          random priest in Egypt around 590 BCE. If we plot all this out, Plato
          retells a 235-year-old story (Feder, 2020).

            >Atlantis</a
          >
          is in the Atlantic outside the straight of Gibraltar. The Egyptian
          priest stresses that the Atlanteans made an unprovoked attack against
          Europe and Asia. Reading the book, we see that Critias was trying his
          best to describe the Atlanteans as evil. After this introduction,
          Timeaus is granted the floor and lectures about the universe's origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heading to Critias, we learn that he first chitchats about ancient
          Athens and how it was 9000 years ago. Just by coincidence, it matches
          Plato's ideas in the Republic to the letter. Isn't this truly
          mysterious? We then learn that the decadent Atlanteans started nobler
          with a godly pedigree but would later turn corrupt. So debased, Zeus
          conjured the other gods to teach the Atlanteans a lesson. Just when
          Zeus is about to regale his plan, the story ceases. Plato seems to
          have abandoned it here and would die a few years later. Luckily or
          possibly unlucky for us, we learned in Timeaus that Atlantis ended
          with an enormous cataclysm that also would end ancient Ath ens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I challenge you listeners to find an ancient source telling a
          comparable account. So far, none have been located (de Camp, 1975;
          Jordan, 2001; Feder, 2020), and isn't that a bit strange? We have only
          found a small portion of the ancient literary body, but combining the
          sources from Egypt, Babylon, Sumer, or Phonecia, we don't see another
          single mention (de Camp, 1975).
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Herodotus</a
          >, who lived only a century before Plato, never mentioned this story
          while writing about aspects of Athenian history. Neither do other
          historians that go into greater detail about the Athenian military
          power both after and before Plato. Why would they leave out such a
          great victory? Most likely because they knew it was not meant to be
          taken literary.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we look at all of this, it becomes clear that the Greeks and
          others after saw this as the literary invention it was intended to be.
          Plato put the story in for the Greeks' mysterious time, just as
          authors put their stories in a distant time. Saying Atlantis is real
          is like claiming Middle Earth is real and that the

            >Flen </a
          >in Sweden. You might object and say that Critias explains the story
          to be true. Still, Tolkien does a similar thing in "The fellowship of
          the ring" the prologue starts with "<em
            >This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a
            reader may discover much of their character and a little of their
            history." </em
          >This does not mean we need to take Tolkien's writings as actual
          events, nor should we with Platon. Authors do pretend their stories
          are real sometime to drive a point. For centuries the story of
          Atlantis was just that, a story. But it would not stay like that
          forever because sometimes stories have other plans.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2>Hyperdiffusion</h2>
        <p>
          Before we get deeper into what Atlantis has to do with everything, and
          we have a more in-depth discussion on the topics Jeb Card brought up.
          I need to explain the base of parts of Hancock's argument here. We
          need to talk about hyperdiffusion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What is hyperdiffusion, and what makes it
          <a
            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hyper"

            rel="noopener"
            >more excited</a
          >
          than normal diffusion? When archaeologists gab about diffusion theory,
          we usually mean this in the sense that we trace how and where
          artifacts unfurl (Scarre, 2018). Diffusion is used not only in
          archaeology but also in history, geography, and economy (Hodder,
          2001). We can observe how a type of object or information spreads from
          one culture to another. We know that our ancestors traveled far and
          wide in the past and encountered different cultures that led to
          imitations or trade.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We often see <em>single-trait diffusion</em>, that a smaller item is
          traded or gifted between cultures. This does not mean that the
          different cultures were in actual contact. In many cases, artifacts
          passed through several cultures before the travel was over. Note that
          this process rarely is one-sided. Trade went two ways back and forth.
          We also see imitations in an area where the original resources were
          scarce at the time. In late neolithic Scandinavia, the import of
          copper was relative later, but the concept was known. We know this
          because
          <a
            href="https://historiska.se/upptack-historien/artikel/en-exklusiv-flintdolk/"

            >copper dagger imitations</a
          >
          somewhat dominated flint tools in Scandinavia (Burenhult, 2003). The
          replicas were so detailed that they even added the seam on the handle
          to keep the leather in place.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeologists can sometimes talk about <em>complex diffusion</em>,
          where one culture seems to imprint on another. These cases are rare
          and far between and usually result from war or colonization.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If we turn the volume up to eleven, we get
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >hyperdiffusion</a
          >. That all cultures and techniques can be traced to a single origin.
          For example, W. Perry and Smith argued that ancient Egypt was the
          penultimate source for all Civilization (Shaw and Jameson, 2008).
          Hyperdifferution was also used in the new world, as we will see later,
          to explain how "primitive people" could build these impressive
          structures. This kind of view is inherently colonial and has been used
          to defend scientific racism, such as
          <a

        </p>
        <p>
          Diffusion is one of those 19th-century ideas that today have been
          replaced with post-processual arguments.
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Gordon_Childe"

            >Gordon Child</a
          >
          and others were using diffusionist mechanisms but implementing a more
          Marxist thought. The focus became more on how diffusion worked in an
          economic environment (Shaw and Jameson, 2008). But it wasn't until
          1970 and the publication of
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Renfrew"

            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Before Civilization</em></a
          ><em>"</em> we started to shift toward a post-processual approach
          (Shaw and Jameson, 2008). Renfrew used radion carbon dating to show
          that the megalithic structures of Europe were independently invented
          in different areas and times. While diffusion still has its place, we
          have come to learn and accept that humans are more complex and
          imaginative than we might give ourselves credit for.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, hyperdiffusion has found a new home with
          alternative history (Card, 2019a). We see this frequently in Ancient
          Aliens; the idea that things resemble each other is due to alien
          involvement and tools. But note that Hyperdifusion carries a darker
          past that neither

          >
          nor Graham Hancock deals with when applying the idea of hyperdiffusion
          in their texts. This idea is tied to attempts to show that a specific
          race, nation, or religion is superior to others (Card, 2019a; Card,
          2019b).&nbsp;

          political office as a radical Republican, and for the time, he was
          regarded as progressive (Colavito, 2018). He supported the suffrage
          movement, was against child labor, and was a proponent of somewhat
          racial justice. Even if the latter part was colored by bigotry, that's

          The hyperdiffusion in Donnelly's work "<em
            >Atlantis: The Antediluvian World</em
          >" is nothing the author tries to conceal. At the book's opening, we
          get 13 points he will prove; number three is that civilization as we
          know it originated in Atlantis. Later, he expands and repeats that all
          cultures must have derived from one common source. While Donnelly
          might have been progressive for his time, it's still far from our
          current ideas. To explain the complex buildings of Mayans and Native
          Americans, he insists that a race of pure blood lived there before
          (Donnelly, 1882:350). The base of the claim isn't new or only thought
          by Ignatius, the president of Chicago the academy of science J.W.
          Foster

            >spoke in similar terms</a
          >. Even if these racist ideas started to be thrown out, it was still a
          long road to walk. Cyrus Thomas's careful investigation and debunking
          of the Mound Builder myth would be released twelve years after the
          release of this book.

          Donnelly's evidence for diffusion ranges far and wide, and nothing is
          too small or too big to include. One part he claims to be evidence is
          that Atlantis had art and so do all other cultures (Donnelly,
          1882:141), it's a true statement, but it does not account for all the
          differences within the art. If the origin of art were a single source,
          would it not be more similar and not show signs of evolution and
          adaption? Looking at Mayan, Greek, Egyptian, and Indian
          <a
            href="https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/policies-and-documents/open-access"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >art</a
          >, we can distinguish between them. Except for them being pieces of
          art created with tools, little tie them together.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Another point Donnelly make is that both the new and old world made
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >bronze</a
          >. But as Dr. Ken Feder (2020) points out, he does not account for the
          diverse ingredients in the alloy. In comparison, old-world bronze is
          made with copper and tin, while the new word bronze where typically
          created by combining copper and arsenic. There it is again, a clear
          indication that these technologies evolved separately. Same with
          <a
            href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/agriculture"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >agriculture</a
          >, while the concept can be found across the globe, the technology and
          approach to it differ. While Europe was dominated by wheat and barley
          in separate fields, the Mayans tended to grow maize, beans, and squash
          in a triad (Sharer and Traxler, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
          Things are not better in the sequel Ragnar&ouml;k where Donnelly
          argues that a meteoric impact caused the continental drift. The
          evidence for this is, according to the book's narrative preserved
          within our mythology, shared through generations as a warning if it
          happened once, it can happen again. You will recognize this narrative
          if you have seen the show or read Hancock's books. Donnelly's first
          book also relies heavily on flood (or deluge, if we want to be fancy)
          myths. You probably heard that flood myths are found worldwide and are
          all leery similar. Almost as if they were crafted from the same
          source. Donnelly certainly thought so, and this is an idea Hancock
          puts forward. But is it true? If we look into Sir James G. Frazer's
          extensive compilation "<a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Flood-Handbook-World-Myths/dp/1481966685"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>The Great Flood</em>,</a
          >" we quickly realize this is not the case. It's more or less the same
          argument that the pyramids of Egypt are identical to the pyramids of
          Mesoamerica, china, or any other location you might think of. While
          Donnelly, in his later book, focuses more on the end-time myths, the
          approach is the same.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I doubt Ignatius Donnely would describe himself as an archeologist or
          historian; his approach was more of a lawyer than a scientist. As Jeb
          Card mentioned in his article on "<em>America before,</em>" we should
          not view Hancock as an archaeologist but as a mythisist. Even Graham
          agreed with Card in response to the SAA magazine cover of his book
          (Hancock, 2019). So approaching Hancock as a person trying to be a
          historian or archaeologist is to miss Graham's goal altogether. But to
          truly understand Hancock's paradigm change, as Jeb talked about, we
          must look a little bit toward the esoteric inspiration.
        </p>
        <h2>Esoterism</h2>
        <p>
          The last piece of the puzzle to understand Hancock's sources and
          paradigm shift can be found in the books on
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_esotericism"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Esoterism</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theosophy"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Theosophy</a
          >, and
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Anthroposophy</a
          >. These connections are familiar to us. We can see them among the
          <a
            href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-idiocy-fabrications-and-lies-of-ancient-aliens-86294030/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Ancient Astronaut</a
          >
          proponents too. Jeb Card mentioned that the Ancient Aliens people have
          shifted toward a more
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >perennial</a
          ><a href="https://voidpod.com/podcasts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >philosophy</a
          >
          (Card, 2019a). Even if I disagree that this shift affects all of the
          most prominent names, some have a more esoteric approach. For example,
          Philipp Coppens and, to some extent, Robert Schoch come to mind. It's
          more than perfectly visible in the writings of Hancock.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2>Theosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I would argue that
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Blavatsky"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Helena Blavatsky</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Rudolf Steiner</a
          >
          are the foundation for how Graham approaches mythical stories. Within
          theosophy, you collect all myths and put them in a barrel, and the
          ones with the most similarities are supposed to be true (Blavatsky,
          1888). At the end of the day, it sounds like diffusion but with some
          flimsier foundation. Just because something is similar does affect its
          truthfulness. It might have helped if Blavatsky had added some more
          criteria for this, but that never came to be.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the core thoughts is that philosophy and religion all originate
          from one source (Blavatsky, 1888). Does it sound familiar? Here's a
          quote "<em
            >No one can study ancient philosophies seriously without perceiving
            that the striking similitude of conception between all</em
          >" she then goes on, "<em
            >during the youth of mankind, one language, one knowledge, one
            universal religion</em
          >." Haven't we seen this before?
        </p>
        <p>
          Blavatsky also writes about Atlantis since it's from where the fourth
          race originates. In her writings, she does talk about a concept called
          root races. Helena wasn't talking about human races, luckily for us,
          maybe, in this case. She where talking about esoteric protohumans. The
          first versions of which were m ore or less "energy." It evolved, and
          the fourth race would become us, and our origin is Atlantis. We also
          had psychic powers, but this faded over time. I enjoy her idea that
          apes originate from bestiality between the fourth race and animals
          (Blavatsky, 1888:201, Feder, 2020). But there is a common idea within
          theosophy that we can communicate with a form of being, spirit, or
          unknown sentience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock speaks about this, too; we see this, for example, in his
          approach to aliens. They did not build things on earth, but they are
          here in a higher form. That there's a "<em
            >consciousness connection</em
          >" among people who are abducted or have an encounter of the third
          kind (Hancock, 2016).
        </p>
        <h2>Anthroposophy</h2>
        <p>
          But we also see traces of Rudolf Steiner in his ideas, less in this
          series. But it's more apparent if we would go and read the 2006 book
          <em>Supernatural</em>, which was re-released with the new title
          <em>Visionary </em>last year. While Steiner was influenced by
          theosophy, he tried to have a more "<em>scientific</em>" approach to
          these ideas. We also have the notion of subraces, but Steiner also
          incorporated the racist beliefs of his time and became influential for
          the Nazi movement (Staudenmaier,2010). But Steiner talks a lot about
          science and how to access a spiritual world parallel to ours.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2>Edgar Cayce</h2>
        <p>
          We should not forget
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Cayce"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Edgar Cayce's</a
          >
          influence on Hancock's work. Cayce is more known as the
          <a
            href="https://topdocumentaryfilms.com/edgar-cayce/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >sleeping prophet</a
          >, the source of some jealousy since he could sleep in his job. This
          prophet is one of the original sources for a much older dating of the
          Sphinx. He came to this realization through his visions; many of them
          were about Atlantis. Cayce claimed to have lived some 700 lives
          (Feder, 2020) in this allegorical city. In one of the visions, he saw
          the survivors from Atlantis travel to Egypt and construct the Sphinx
          to cover "<a
            href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/uncovering-secrets-of-the-sphinx-5053442/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >The Hall of Records</a
          >" Cayce claimed to be located beneath. What time of the construction?
          10 000 BCE. We saw the influence of this idea on Schoch in
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-24-sphinx-and-the-grail.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >an earlier episode</a
          >. But I think it&rsquo;s important to note here that Cayce was not
          too familiar with the material. For example, he claimed that
          Solon&rsquo;s Egyptians knew nothing about Atlantis's achievements
          (Jordan, 2001). While it&rsquo;s unclear is Cayce ever read Platon, we
          are sure that some of his faith-healing patients where Blavatskians
          who shared their knowledge.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is to the sphere of magic that Hancock wishes to bring science. It
          is not out to overthrow post-processualism, Clovis, or revert to
          diffusionism Hancock is after. It's to get back to when the
          universities were part science and part magic show. As Card put it, he
          wants to become Newton in a sense. He wants an esoteric approach to
          these myths and applies theosophic and anthroposophic ideas. The
          sooner we understand that he is not trying to be a historian or
          archaeologist, we can't stomp out these ideas. I know we want to
          believe everyone wants to be an archaeologist, but we need to stop
          imprinting this on him. We need to accept that we need more than
          material evidence; we need to understand these magical ideas
          adequately. Let's finish this section the same way Jeb Card (2019a)
          "Hancock is not a failed version of an archaeologist. He is a
          successful mythographer in a post-science age".&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I think you have a better understanding of the origin and foundation
          of Hancocks' ideas. Before we move on to the actual claims in the
          show, we should bring forth that this show uses the

          we have seen in Ancient Aliens (and many other shows). We have reports
          coming that experts who agreed to come on have been
          <a href="https://sciencefriction.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >edited out of context</a

            >Heritage Malta</a

            >Being heavily edited and quoted out of context further supports
            point.</em
          >" Ancient Apocalypse and Ancient Aliens are not the only shows or
          documentaries that have done this. It's so common that there's a
          documentary on this phenomenon. So to help us with some tips on how to
          spot pseudoscience and the editing experts' phenomenon, we will
          quickly introduce our next guest.
        </p>
        <h3>Spotting pseudoscience:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Lack of empirical evidence or reliance on anecdotal evidence</li>
          <li>Use of vague, exaggerated or unprovable claims</li>
          <li>
            Use of scientific terms without proper explanation or understanding
          </li>
          <li>Reliance on authority, rather than objective evidence</li>
          <li>Lack of consistency with established scientific knowledge</li>
          <li>Resistance to change or criticism</li>
          <li>Use of confirmation bias to selectively report data</li>
          <li>
            Lack of transparency and openness in research methods and data
          </li>
          <li>Use of logical fallacies in reasoning</li>
          <li>Use of anecdotal evidence and testimonials to support claims</li>
          <li>Use of secrecy in research methods and data</li>
          <li>Use of non-peer-reviewed publications to disseminate findings</li>
          <li>Use of non-reproducible methods and results</li>
          <li>Use of misleading graphics or statistics</li>
          <li>Use of pseudonyms or anonymous sources to publish research.</li>
