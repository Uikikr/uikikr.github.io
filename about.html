            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              Who am I? I'm glad you asked. My name is Fredrik Trusohamn, and
              I'm the creator and host of Digging Up Ancient Aliens. I'm using
              my schooling in Archaeology and a bit of Osteology to evaluate and
              explore the claims raised in the tv-show Ancient Aliens. The
              education was achieved at the University of Gotland, a
              medium-sized island in the Baltic Sea. The main interest has
              always been the Scandinavian Vendel and Viking age. But afraid of
              dirt under your nails, you can't be, so I've been involved in a
              few excavations, from potential neolithic settlements to a Viking
              age village.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've since long been interested in the obscure and paranormal, but
              the information provided always felt lacking. But I began
              searching for answers outside the forums and paranormal books,
              learning critical thinking and skepticism, and looking at the
              world differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              When you start archaeology, you will notice that people often say
              one of two things when they hear this. It's either "I always
              wanted to be that when I was a child" or "Did you know" followed
              by some strange claim. This got me to start researching these
              pseudo-archaeological claims, trying to figure out what on Earth
              they talked about. I only spent a little bit on it since it was
              clearly wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
              But as the amount of misinformation increased during the Covid
              pandemic, I started to think about what I could do to help spread
              good information. Suddenly I realized that even if I'd heard about
              Ancient Aliens, I had paid little attention to it. It's been on
              for 18 seasons and is quite popular, so they might show the best
              evidence for their claims.&nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
              So I'm here armed with skepticism, critical thinking, the latest
              research in archaeology, and Swedish dad jokes. Let's see what
              evidence the Ancient Astronaut Theorists have and if it holds up
              when we scrape it with our trowels.
            </p>
