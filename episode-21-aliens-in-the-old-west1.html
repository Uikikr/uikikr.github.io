          A warm and starry night in Texas. Except for a few crickets chirping
          and the wind rustling the trees, the night is dead silent. The small
          town's population is all in its beds. Not yet aware, this one-horse
          town would be thrown into the UFO frontier with an ear-deafening
          crash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our host Fredrik continues the mission to discover what is genuine,
          fake, and somewhere in between on the TV show Ancient Aliens. This
          time we'll look into the first half of episode 1 from season 3
          (S03E01) called "Aliens in the old west." It will be an exciting
          journey through American history where they somewhat will focus on the
          era of the Cowboys. Even if we don't encounter them much here in the
          first part, they will come later.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this episode, we'll cover the Aurora UFO incident and the Serpent
          mound. We'll cover the latest research and theories about these
          topics. We will also cover a bit of New-Age history and Plastic
          Shamans.&nbsp;

          Right at the beginning, the typical ideas about what the Wild West
          entailed are taken up. The speaker talks about covered wagons heading
          out, cowboys riding leisurely into town, drinking in saloons, and
          Indians wearing war paint. But then they add that this is an
          embellished version of how things really were. This is true; the ideas
          about the old west come from dime novels and old Hollywood movies. For
          being such a show, this is quite a refreshing addition to what is
          shown. But do not worry; this brief foray into reality will quickly
          disappear when they start covering what is presented to us in this
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the intro, we first see what looks like a reenactment but is
          surprisingly high quality. But when you see Harrison Ford and Daniel
          Craig, you realize its product placement. This is a preview of the
          2011 movie "<em>Cowboys and Aliens</em>". The show tries to sell the
          film and explains a bit of the plot; this is entirely new for the show
          with this level of product placement. I have not seen this movie, and
          it might be an excellent bonus episode. Then the narrator admits that
          the film and the comic book it's based on are made up. But he adds
          that some parts could be inspired by actual events! Yehaa
        </p>
        <h3 id="aliencrash">The alien who crashed in Texas</h3>
        <p>
          We opened in Aurora, Texas - the name sounded very familiar to me. So
          when the show started discussing the cemetery, I knew what it would be
          about. So we're going to talk about the alien who's said to have been
          buried here in Texas in the 1800s.
        </p>
        <p>We meet Jim Marrs walking in a cemetery, and he says:</p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Aurora's cemetery was founded in 1861, right at the start of
            the war between states. Texas State Historical Commission has a
            marker here that states the cemetery is well known because of the
            legend that a spaceship crashed nearby in 1897, and the pilot killed
            in the crash was buried here.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          The crash occurred about 50 years before the Roswell incident, but we
          meet a new face in Jeff Danelek. He tells the story of this long-ago
          crash UFO along with Jim Marrs. On the screen, we see newspaper
          clippings as evidence of what happened back then.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are unfamiliar with the story, the show presents it as follows.
        </p>

          In the early morning of 17 April 1897, a UFO reportedly crashed into
          the wings of Judge Proctor's windmill and burst into flames. The
          explosion could be heard far and wide. It threw the ground into a
          violent, shaking motion that could be felt in even the farthest
          corners of their small town. The local reporter arrived on the scene
          and reported a large debris field and the charred remains of an
          extraterrestrial being. The traveler was given a Christian burial at
          the town cemetery - the supposed remains from another planet still lie
          under the bent branch of an old tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jim Marrs adds this little gem to make sure that we as viewers should
          agree that it must have been a UFO:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"In 1897, this was six years before the Wright Brothers actually
            made heavier-than-air craft work. So, this is why I consider the
            Aurora spaceship crash the smoking gun of the UFO controversy,
            because this occurred six years before there was anything man-made
            in the air."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's listen carefully to what Jim Marrs is telling us here. First, he
          says that this was six years before heavier-than-air flights. That's
          wrong. It's true that the Wright Brothers successfully launched the
          first engine-powered airplane. It's also true that the aircraft the
          Wright Brothers used is one of the "heavier-than-air" airplanes.
          However, this aircraft type includes rockets, airplanes, helicopters,
          and gliders. Sir George Cayley is considered the inventor of
          aerodynamics and created the first man-carrying glider in the 1850s.
          I'd grant Jimmy that there probably weren't many gliders in Texas at
          the time. But balloons. Jim Marrs conveniently omits lighter-than-air
          crafts.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Lighter-than-air flights are anything that uses gas to get a lift. So
          hot air balloons, blimps, hydrogen balloons, and other flying machines
          float in the air. Manned balloon flights have been around since 1
          December 1783, when Professor Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers
          made the first known manned flight. From then on, things continued to
          evolve. The Union Army even had its own division, the Union Army
          Balloon Corps, during the Civil War. After that, balloons were used
          mainly for recognizance. Even Napoleon used balloons during his
          campaigns. In July of the same year the alien crash is said to have
          occurred, the Swede Salomon August Andree launched his balloon
          "&Ouml;rnen" (Eagle) to reach the North Pole. The attempt went wrong,
          and he crashed just two days later. It is quite a tragic story, but it
          all shows that there were many man-made things in the air at that
          time. Maybe not a common sight, but it's not as if people would run
          away in fear if a balloon appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know this is fiction, but even in the Red Dead Redemption 2 game,
          part of the action takes place in a hot air balloon. Ballooning was a
          hobby for some at the time, just as it's today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then it continues with the narrator explaining that it could be
          evidence, but some were taken by the law or thrown into a well. Pretty
          mixed here; both could've happened. I get the feeling that they only
          bring up the law enforcement to bring up associations with Roswell and
          Area 51. We won't really pursue this thread anymore through the
          section. We learn quickly that the show and most UFO investigators
          prefer the well hypothesis.
        </p>
        <h4 id="mufon">MUFON</h4>
        <p>
          The Aurora case has been presented as one of the best cases for
          extraterrestrial visitation. In 1973, Earl Watts and Bill Case of
          MUFON (Mutual UFO Network or Midwest UFO Network) led an investigation
          into it. They interviewed local residents, collected newspapers, and
          even collected scrap metal that they believed came from the crash.
          It's not specified exactly where this scrap metal was found, but they
          did test a bit of scrap aluminum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, there have been other investigations, for example, by Bill
          Porterfield and Kevin D. Randell. We'll come back to what they've to
          say a little later.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's get back to the well and what's in it. The Proctor farm was
          purchased by a man named Brawley Oates. We'll then spend a little time
          meeting Oates. Or we don't meet Oates in person, but Jeff Danalek and
          Phillip Coppens talk about him, and we also see a picture of Oates. In
          the photo, we can see quite clearly that he suffers from a severe case
          of arthritis.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Jeff Danalek describes, Brawley Oates bought the farmland and
          started to clean out the well on the property. We must assume that
          this is the same well into which Proctor dumped the debris that day in
          April. Danalek and Coppens speculate that the well must've contained
          some element, probably a radioactive one, that caused Oates arthritis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Going through the MUFON files of their investigation, we find that
          Oates claimed to some reporters that doctors believed radiation might
          be behind it. In another article, the radiation idea appears to have
          come from a passerby during the interview. However, investigators
          conducted several radiation tests, and the radiation was never above
          background levels. As we read the files and newspaper clippings,
          another story about Oates comes to life. We learn that the Oates
          family lost a very young daughter and that both Brawley and his wife
          developed arthritis. I feel for the family; they have been through a
          lot. It seems to me that the Oates needed something to blame, and this
          story seems to have become the target. Finding a scapegoat is a human
          reaction. Unfortunately, this reaction was highjacked by the UFO
          crowd.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence doesn't support the claim that radiation levels at the
          farm are higher than average. The program presents the radiation
          theory as the only cause, but as far as I know, that doesn't seem to
          be the case. There are several causes of arthritis and also different
          versions of this disease. Genetics also plays a prominent role in how
          severe arthritis can become. From what we see in the show, the best
          guess is that it would be Rheumatoid arthritis. This version can cause
          severe swelling and deformation. Luckily modern treatment can stop
          this from becoming what we see in the show. Rheumatoid arthritis is
          mainly caused by genetic traits, but it's been shown that smoking can
          increase the risk for the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Phillip Coppens concludes this segment by telling us that the Oates'
          descendants filled the well. The show leaves the Oates here, and I
          don't think we've much more to add. The narrator explains how the
          Roswell incident has reignited interest in this forgotten alien crash.
          But apparently not enough because no one really started looking into
          it until the 70s.

        <h4 id="exhumate">Exhumate a alien?</h4>
        <p>
          John Waylen, who may be familiar to comics fans among you as the
          author of "The Big Book Of The Weird Wild West," published by DC
          Comics. Waylen tells us that he and other researchers wanted to exhume
          the body. But the local cemetery board didn't want that, so they
          turned it down. But even if some say the grave's location is known,
          that could be wrong. Digging up a grave in a cemetery where people are
          still mourning could upset local residents.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we get the following quote from Marshall Trimble:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"My first question is, why not? What's it gonna hurt? As a
            historian, it makes me suspicious when somebody is trying to hide
            something from you. Tells you, you can't, you can't do
            something."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Marshall Trimble wears a giant cowboy hat and is a country singer.
          He's also the official state historian of Arizona. But I think he
          should know better than that. There are several laws governing
          exhumations that you can't just do for fun and games. Most of these
          laws include that the gravesite needs to be known because you don't
          want to accidentally dig up someone else. There are other things, but
          according to current US law, the grave's location is unknown and,
          therefore, would not qualify for exhumation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're now going to meet Jim Marrs on-site at Aurora Cemetery. He tells
          us that he's one of the few people who know the original location of
          the gravesite. That's because he was there, and the program put up a
          few pictures of what appears to be a minor flat sandstone that is
          supposed to be the grave marker. But this was removed under mysterious
          circumstances. UFO-Researcher Kevin D. Randell spent a lot of time in
          Aurora in 1970 and then heard that the headstone was a larger stone
          with an airship. However, when he visited the cemetery, he could find
          no such stone. He also didn't see the small stone we see in the
          pictures and suggested that it was probably added after his
          visits.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Jim Marrs continues:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Now, back in 1973, Bill Case was the aviation writer for the
            Dallas Times Herald. I was working for the Star-Telegram. We met up
            here. He had a metal detector, and we found three readings of metal
            in the grave. A couple of months after the headstone went missing,
            Bill invited me to meet him up here. We went over the grave, and
            there was no readings in the grave. He showed me three little holes
            that had been drilled in the grave. Somebody had extracted the metal
            out of the grave."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          A decent metal detector can find coin-sized objects at a depth of 45
          cm (18 inches) under good conditions. 45 cm is pretty far above the
          usual depth of a grave. Some detectors can go deeper, but they're
          pretty expensive even today. We should perhaps remember that the price
          of the cheapest Coinmaster in 1971 was $169 or $1236 in today's money.
          I doubt what Jim Marrs said took place, and if it did, it would have
          taken something bigger than boreholes to extract it. Marrs claims that
          scientists have found evidence using ground penetrating radar that
          there was a child-sized grave. But GPR doesn't usually show what has
          been somewhere, and the readings or scientists aren't presented. I
          couldn't really find them now while preparing for this program.

        <h4 id="auroracrash">The real story of the Aurora Crash</h4>
        <p>
          Let's go back to that morning in April when it all began. This is
          where the show leaves us, dusts off its hands, and goes to a new
          place. But we haven't gotten the whole story yet; quite the opposite.
          The article in the Dallas Morning News of 19 April 1897 reads as
          follows:

            settling toward the earth. It sailed directly over the public
            square, and when it reached the north part of the town collided with
            the tower of Judge Proctor's windmill and went to pieces with a
            terrific explosion, scattering debris over several acres of ground,
            wrecking the windmill and water tank and destroying the judge's
            flower garden.</em

        <p>
          The article was written by S. E. Haydon and has a bit of flowery prose
          in it. But if we start to look into this article, we will find more.
          Brian Dunning has done an excellent job in his episode 241, "<em
            >The Alien Buried in Texas</em
          >," tracing down similar tongue-in-cheek articles about air flights.
          Everything from singing men throwing down temperance tracks to aerial
          monsters piloted by men from New York. As we mentioned earlier, even
          if balloons were infrequent, they were known among the population. It
          would have been something the town gossiped about among each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          The figures in the article have been tracked down by both Bill
          Porterfield and Kevin D Randel. T. J. Weems, for example, was the
          town's blacksmith. He admitted to comprehending little to nothing
          about astronomy. Mr. Haydon was a businessman in the area, trading
          cotton and penning for the local paper. Proctor was, in fact, a judge
          and did have two mills on the site.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          From the evidence, it seems as if this article was a spoof to lighten
          up the spirit in the town. Aurora had been struck by both two
          epidemics and their harvests by pests. Few people remain, and those
          who stayed seem to have done their best about the situation. Judge
          Proctor even rewrote the story in a rebuttal towards Haydon that
          apparently had the local constable in fits of laughter.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe the article was an attempt to put Aurora back on the map, an
          endeavor that succeeded but some 70 years too late. Perhaps it just
          was a joke between a few friends trying to keep up the town spirit.
          But from what we have gathered, I think we can safely say that there
          is no alien in Aurora, Texas.
        </p>
        <h3 id="serpentmound">Serpent Mound</h3>
        <p>
          But let's turn our attention to another state: Ohio. More precisely,
          to Adams County, some of you may already know what we'll be dealing
          with there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show's narrator tells us about settlers that were awarded land
          grants by George Washington for serving in the revolutionary war. When
          reaching the area, they encountered the Serpent mound and other mound
          s in the surrounding countryside. These were among the first settlers
          to learn about the Serpent mound and conveyed this back east.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the mound is quite marvelous, and they don't cover this in the
          episode, but there are more mounds and graves in the area. It's been
          occupied since at least the Adena culture that lived between 800
          BCE-100 CE. Two of the largest conical mounds in the area have Adena
          artifacts, so we know this place has been an important site for over
          two millennials.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also met Dr. Brad Lepper, who might stand out a little bit to some.
          He is the Senior Curator of Archaeology at the Ohio Historical Society
          and has had a long career as an archeologist. He has also published
          articles with Ken Feder that you should remember from previous
          episodes. They wrote with others a few articles for the Sceptical
          Inquire.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lepper is a tad ashamed of his appearance here, even today. The show
          contacted the Ohio Historical Society with some false pretenses so
          Brad would appear. Of the three-hour interview, only this quote was
          used:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Serpent Mound was one of the amazing mysterious mounds found by the
            first that came over the Appalachian Mountains. There are thousands
            of mounds, but the Serpent Mound must have been special.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          I think we understand what he means by this, and it's not that there
          is an alien connection. But this is used so a viewer will feel it
          might be true if the professionals address it this way. We then got
          the Nazca connection which was not really a surprise. The argument
          from Childress here is the same as with the Nazca lines; how could you
          build this without being airborne? But in reality, you only need
          simple tools like rope, stakes, and maybe someone in a tree. But
          people visit the site every day and see it is snake shaped while
          walking on the ground. The mound might look better from above, but
          that's a bonus for us today.

          But let's have a break from the show and talk a bit about the serpent
          mound to give it some context. This ancient site was first described
          to white settlers and documented by E. Squire and E. Davis in 1846.
          It's on their drawing that the restoration we can see today is based.
          You can see the etching if you go to the show notes on the website. If
          you look at the serpent mound, you will notice that the tail is
          coiled, then the body somewhat straightens, and at the head, it seems
          as if it is trying to swallow an egg. But other depictions from before
          the restoration show the mound a bit differently. For example, in
          1884, John MacLean depicted it almost the same but with a frog leaping
          away from the egg. You can see this also on the website. MacLean did
          associate this with a story he heard from the Native Americans in the
          area. Now the missing frog might help us date the mound later but
          let's see what the alienists have to say. We have Ross Hamilton
          leading us on telling us.

          "<em
            >Serpent Mound had no burials. It's one of those mysterious mounds
            that offered us no clue as to who the builders were, but on the
            property, there were burial mounds dated from about a very early
            period, nearly 3,000 years ago.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Now he is somewhat correct. The mound has no burial, but this is not
          uncommon for effigy mounds. The Alligator Effigy mound in Granville,
          Ohio, does not contain graves, just to mention an example. Before you
          ask, yes, there are more effigy mounds, not that the show acknowledges
          this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We mentioned before that the area's conical mounds are associated with
          the Adena culture dating back 3000 years ago. Ross Hamilton is correct
          with that claim and that we are not entirely sure who exactly built
          the serpent. This has been debated for a long time, and as we are
          today, there are two contenders. The previously mentioned Adeena
          culture and the Fort Ancient culture. Both have lived in this space
          but at very different times in history.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area was first excavated by Frederic Putnam, who thought it was
          probably built by an earlier group of people. From what I've read,
          Putnam seems to have not been too impressed by Native American
          society. This claim is based more on the racist ideas of the time
          rather than scientific reasoning. Or a better wording might be that
          the science was heavily based on racist theories.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The more prevailing idea is that the mound was built by Adena, and
          then the Fort Ancient culture repaired the site that had fallen in
          disrepair. One of the main arguments for this theory is a couple of
          core samples. These were taken during an excavation in 2014 of the
          mound.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Core samples have been used for some time but have been problematized
          lately. Danish scientists did publish a paper in 2019 where they could
          show that dating charcoal obtained by core samples usually added up to
          3000 years to the datings. This is due to charcoal from the topsoil
          being picked up when taken during collection, skewing the dates. You
          can find the paper "Dating Ancient Burial Mounds in Denmark &ndash;
          Revealing Problematic Ancient Charcoal". This does not mean the
          samples are contaminated, but there is a possibility. Especially when
          we compare these datings to charcoal collected during an excavation
          back in 1991. These were in situ from the mound's base layer and were
          dated to Fort Ancient territory.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The competing theory suggested by Dr. Brad Lepper and others thinks
          it's more likely that the Serpent mound was built by the Fort Ancient
          culture. They base this on the fact that serpents have not been
          represented in Adena art, except for maybe on the Adena Effigy Pipe.
          So it would be weird that their only mound would be of a
          serpent.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The serpent does have a vital place in Fort Ancient and Mississippian
          culture. Both of these cultures did interact with each other and are
          seen as sister cultures by scholars today. Now, what do Mississippian
          have to do with all this? In Mississippian art, we have three elements
          that often appear and have a special meaning within the culture. An
          egg, a frog, and a serpent. This is believed to refer to the "making
          of the earth rite" or the creation story. In the picture cave, they
          have made C14 samples of coal used as a pigment in the serpent
          petroglyph. The specimen obtained again puts this serpent in the same
          period as the datings from the serpent mound in 1991.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We can't forget the Effigy mound culture between circa 700 CE to 1100
          CE. Another culture that built similar types of mounds closer in time
          to the Fort Ancient culture. Again, I and others find it strange that
          there would be such a long gap from the first example to the next one.
          You might think I have not proven either here, and no, I haven't. To
          be honest, even if Lepper and others have done great work the last few
          years with this theory, we might still need more to get a definite
          answer. Trying to get better and in situ material to date and continue
          the research. But it needs to be done closely with the Native
          Americans who claim this site as their heritage. This has slowly
          started, and the Shawnee tribe has been invited back to reclaim what
          they see as their ancestral monument. We will talk more about this in
          a moment. But this is exciting research, and I am interested in
          learning where all of this will lead in the future. This has been an
          exciting journey learning more about this site. But let's get back to
          the show now when we better understand the history of the site and the
          actual discussion taking place about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of going into the more accurate history of the serpent mound
          as we did, the show will start to make things up. We're taken to a
          nearby crater with the unfortunate name "<em
            >Serpent mound impact crater." </em
          >The hole has been known since the 1960s and is some 8 kilometers in
          diameter. But there's nothing special about it that confuses
          researchers about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what would Ancient Aliens be if we did not have some silly claims?
          We meet Thomas Johnsson, who claims that there are magnetic anomalies
          around the mound. Giorgio Tsoukalos chimes in, claiming that there are
          places at the ridge where compasses are just spinning and spinning.
          What he is describing is a magic trick. If there's a magnetic
          disturbance, the needle does not point north; there are locations like
          that across the globe. I'm not sure if Georgio is aware of that or
          not. Though I've discussed an anomaly, I encountered where a compass
          didn't work at an excavation. That time it turned out to be the
          motherload of iron slag from a smith causing this. But if you want to
          impress Georgio at his live show, just learn how to palm a magnet and
          circle it behind the compass.
        </p>
        <p>
          These claims are a little silly but not racist enough; let's add some
          of that. Thomas Johnson will help us:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The myth is that the Native Americans, when they came here, could
            see birds similar to passenger pigeons, or homing pigeons, circling
            by the millions. Because within the skull of the pigeon is a little
            piece of hematite or magnetite, and that's how they navigate. And
            they couldn't figure out where the north was. Can you imagine
            millions of birds flying in a circle five miles wide?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          This myth seems to be invented by Thomas Johnson for reasons known
          only to him. Johnson is a former factory worker, trilobite enthusiast,
          rock shop owner, and a new-age peddler. But he is not an expert on
          serpent mound, native Americans, or biology. He is credited as the
          House of Phacops Museum owner in the show, but this is a shop that
          sells different rocks and has a few trilobites on display. The claims
          about the birds themselves are plain silly. Sure, some birds have a
          magnetic sense called "magnetoreception," but they rely on landmarks
          and routes they've learned most of the time. But this claim is
          dangerous because he invents myths and credits them to native
          Americans to sell his new age humbug. We will discuss this more later,
          so let's continue for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show now tells us why the site is essential to aliens since we
          haven't mentioned it until now. So the reason this site is vital to
          the aliens because the meteorite deposited Iridium, iron, and uranium
          here. That itself is true; meteorites can deposit minerals on impact
          if they are present, and Iridium is a common meteorite mineral. So the
          alien basically came here to mine Iridium as you do. I mean, it's not
          like other planets have more meteoric impacts and, therefore, a higher
          yield and return. But maybe I just overthink things, and the show does
          claim there's evidence! There are caves within this crater the size of
          a medium-sized Village. From the example presented in the episode, it
          seems like a natural cave. But Ross Hamilton, who shows us this cave
          somewhere in the area, is confident it is something more. But we don't
          learn how he knows this is an alien mine, not a cavern. Instead, he
          continues the trend of making up Native American myths.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Serpent Mound is a marker for space according to the Shawnee
            Indians. They're convinced that space travelers are using Serpent
            Mound as a marker.</em

        <h4 id="plasticshamans">
          Plastic Shamans and usurpation of traditions
        </h4>
        <p>
          Now how do I know that Ross Hamilton made this up? Because the Shawnee
          has told this themselves. The cultural appropriation of Native
          American customs, sites, and religion is so widespread that it has a
          word among activists. Plastic shamans. These started to pop up when
          white, middle-aged suburban baby boomers began to look for something
          more spiritual. This is where the New Age movement was born, and it
          was not due to a spiritual awakening. The main goal of the New Age is
          consumerism; they want to sell you courses, stones, healing, and a
          sense of spirituality.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why the religion of indigenous people in North America has been so
          heavily appropriated is a critical question to ask. I think Rayna
          Green describes this quite well in the article "The tribe called
          Wannabee." As Reyna Green describes, Euro-Americans and Europeans have
          liked to "play Indian," as she calls it. There's been a long tradition
          of playing Indian in other settings, such as in the Wild west shows,
          and in 1800 they were incorporated into medicine shows as healers. The
          shakers picked up the idea of native American spirits and grew from
          there. The appropriation of Native American spirituality had been
          ongoing for some time. But it was not until after World War 2 a few
          "plastic shamans" started to pop up. The plastic shamans didn't get
          big, though, until the New Age movement in 1970. But the idea shared
          is built on cherry-picking of traditions and exploitation of
          indigenous peoples' practices.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The main argument for why New Age is not a religion per se is that you
          don't have a creed in the New Age movement, no memberships or tenants.
          It's in studies shown as a loosely tied group of white, middle-aged
          people who pay to go to conventions and buy books and music.
          Participating in classes led primarily by other white people playing
          the role of Shaman. Usually, these Shamans take on an invented
          backstory, how they were taken in by Native American shamans and were
          given spiritual gifts and knowledge. The created teacher is often
          blind. We see that trait in New York Times bestseller Lynn Andrew's
          backstory. She claims that two Cree Indian medicine women, Agnes
          Whistling Elk and Ruby Plenty Chiefs took her in and teched her
          ancient native American spirituality. According to Andrews, Ruby
          Plenty Chiefs is supposed to be blind, like Mary Summer Rains mentor
          and many others.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The expropriation of other cultures has been a long-time issue in
          "History!" programming and continues the tradition to this day. We
          have seen much of it in previous episodes and will see more of it
          going forward. I've linked a few papers on the cultural appropriation
          of Native American traditions, from Rayna Green and "Plastic Shamans
          and Astroturf Sun Dances" by Lisa Aldred, to mention some examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's return to Ross Hamiltons' claim about the Shawnee tribe, who
          have officially been invited back to the Serpent mound as the rightful
          descendants. It's a small step, but it's something in the right
          direction and happened recently. Ben Barnes and Glenna Wallace from
          the Shawnee Tribe and Eastern Shawnee Tribe spent some time last year
          during the summer equinox giving lectures about the site and its
          importance to the tribe members. But why the Soaring Eagle Retreat is
          allowed to have its summer solstice event on the site is beyond me.
          Soaring Eagle Retreat is technically not on the site, but they are
          located just on the border and seem to have their events on the mound.
          They specialize in New-Age workshops and events, if you haven't
          guessed already. In an article, it's described that Barnes And
          Wallace's speech is interrupted by New Agers demanding the chiefs to
          participate in their "play." The individuals then complained that the
          Shawnee members were rude due to not accepting their pipe-smoking
          offer. It's beyond my understanding how people can be so disconnected
          from reality to think that Native Americans would participate in
          cultural appropriation.&nbsp;

        <h4 id="draconisconnection">
          The Draconis connection, electric stones, and pyramids
        </h4>
        <p>
          We're still not done with the Serpent mound, and Ross Hamilton, who
          does not appear in any other episode, gets a lot of airtime. He says:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The serpent itself was aligned to a constellation that had its apex
            at the height of the night sky 5,000 years ago. The constellation
            Draconis &ndash; it was used to align the Great Pyramid</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          I think Ross Hamilton is trying to allude to the fact that the mound
          is much older or that the builders got the information from an
          extraterrestrial source. The serpent mound does not align with
          Draconis since the constellation is from Greece and greek mythology.
          To give Ross an out, we can mention that Thuban, a star in the
          constellation, was the polestar until 3000 BCE. Due to the earth's
          rotation, the pole star changes between a few stars. But no, besides
          maybe the northern pole star, there's no relation between the Draconis
          constellation and the Serpent mound.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have some more Ross coming up here. We also have him walking at an
          outcropping, stating that it's pure limestone or dolomite. Sharon Hill
          from the Spooky Geology Podcast helped me pull some info on the area,
          and according to the Ohio geological interactive map, the site should
          be dolomite. Hamilton also claims that the quality is better than the
          limestone used in the pyramid of Giza. But this claim is quite silly,
          and as Sharon told me, "<em
            >Being that this kind of rock is extremely common, any claim that
            the rock is special or has interesting properties doesn't amount to
            anything.</em
          >"&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ross then stands beside a stone on the ground and looking at it, you
          could see some resemblance with a pillar. He claims that this stone
          has excellent conductive powers and must have been placed in the
          serpent at one point. This was to attract lightning to generate
          electric power for the spaceship. But we do not learn how far it is
          from the site or how he realized this. But sure, dolomite and
          limestone can be conductive. But it's not really due to the stone but
          more that it's rotten or porous leading to water entering the rock,
          and it's with the water that the electricity travels through the
          stone. We have heard similar electricity generator claims in the past,
          most notably with the pyramid. Though again, it's not the stone
          itself. We've also excavated the site, and nothing in the mound shows
          anything that could be used to store electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ross Hamilton has no credentials in any area relevant to what he
          speaks of. Other than a few self-published books, there's nothing much
          about him, really. This shows when you listen to him and read what he
          has written. It's fantasy more than fact; he closed out the segment
          about the mound with this quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >When the lightning lamps were eliminated, the native culture fell
            into the darkness again, about 5,000 years ago. But we know that if
            their prophecies hold true, the Serpent Mound will be reactivated
            again one day. And when that re-activation occurs, that'll be the
            beginning of the restoration of the earth.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's get back to Barnes and Wallace. Both have worked hard to educate
          people on the actual history of the mound. To wash away the new age
          alien claims, Barnes and Wallace are working with scientists and local
          authorities to provide a good understanding of the site. I would like
          to let Ben Barnes close our section on this with a quote from the
          Solar solstice presentation 2021:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Unfortunately the Serpent Mound has become the epicenter of efforts
            to appropriate sacred American Indian sites and replace the
            Indigenous story with all sorts of fantastic, absurd stories.
            /&hellip;/Let's be absolutely clear. At the heart of these myths and
            fantastic stories is the racist notion that American Indians were
            too stupid to have built something so wonderful</em

          This is where we are going to leave it for this week. But we will

          about Mormons' ties to Ancient Aliens. Could it be that the angel

          The intro music was created by Alexander Nakarada, and our outro is by
