          Are the alien encounters in Ancient Greece mythologies? Could Central
          America have had flight 500 years ago? Archaeology explains these
          supposed mysteries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Could it be conceivable that the tales of myths, legends, and divine
          entities are evidence of extraterrestrial interactions with our
          planet? It is plausible that the ancient Greek writers, historians,
          and intellectuals could not accurately express what they observed due
          to a lack of language and understanding. Did Greek history writers
          describe invisibility and cloaking devices? Additionally, is it
          possible that the La Danza de los Voladores, an ancient Central
          American tradition, proves that humans could fly five centuries ago?
          Most likely not but let's find out what's what with some science and
          skepticism.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are not only asking questions here; we will answer them by learning
          more about Greek Mythology, moral philosophy, voyeuristic kings and
          bodyguards, and of course, mesoamerican ritual practices. So pull up a
          chair, relax, and let's uncover what's true or not.

          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Could gods from Ancient Greece have their origins on other planets,
          descending to Earth to share their wisdom? Did Plato describe an
          invisibility machine way ahead of his time, and is a Mesoamerican
          ritual evidence for ancient flight? Most likely not but let&rsquo;s
          find out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is episode 39, and I'm your host, Fredrik. This will be an
          exciting episode where we will spend most of our time dealing with
          Greek religion and mythology. Toward the end, I will talk a little
          about the Danza de los Voladores tradition from Mesoamerica and how
          shows like Ancient Aliens misuse these stories to promote their
          agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is also an exciting episode since it's the first one as part
          of the Archaeological Podcast Network. Home of shows like Dr.
          Kinkellas Psuedo-archaeology Podcast, A Life in Ruins, Heritage
          Voices, and the Rock Art Podcast. If you listen through the main feed,
          I wish you a bit extra welcome.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="religion">Greek religion and UFO</h2>
        <p>
          So we are back in Ancient Greece, a location that's become a steady
          stream of inspiration for Ancient Alien theorists. But why are we
          here? Well, that is an excellent question there, my dear listener,
          because I'm not convinced that the producers of this episode knew
          either. As we've learned, the Ancient Alien show was not supposed to
          run more than one season. Surprisingly, the show was renewed for three
          seasons, which caused the creators to rush to produce enough content.
          As a result, some of the episodes feel repetitive or similar to
          previous ones. This is one of them, and if you have been listening for
          a while, we dealt with Greek mythology back in episode 18, together
          with the Drunk Mythology Gals. I'll try not to repeat myself here, but
          there might be some overlap. Let's delve deeper into Greek Mythology.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let's clarify the meaning of "myth" for the ancient Greeks, as
          this term has different connotations for us modern humans. Typically,
          when we use the word "myth," we imply that it is untrue or fictional.
          In the context of Greek language and culture, the term "Mythos" means
          language, word, or simply a story. While these stories may contain
          elements of truth or historical fact, they are not necessarily meant
          to be taken as literal accounts of events. Instead, they often serve
          as vehicles for conveying important moral or philosophical messages or
          as a means of exploring complex human emotions and experiences. As
          such, mythos can be viewed as existing on a continuum between
          objective truth and subjective interpretation, depending on the
          perspective of the individual or community engaging with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no right or wrong version of the myths among the Greeks;
          they changed and grew organically depending on who, where, and why
          they were told. The myth was meant to be narrated to an audience, not
          read in private, and that's why we have different versions of the same
          tale. Cities might highlight various aspects to make their influence
          greater, or poets might change parts to make the narrative fit with
          the ideals of the time. While the plot and characters might be
          similar, the content and main lesson might differ broadly. There was,
          so to say, no authoritative version of these myths, and most Greeks
          would probably think of there being only one correct version of these
          myths rather strange.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what function did these myths have in the society? Well, for
          starters, one function is actually entertainment. Many of these myths
          survived through plays and other forms of performance arts. Remember,
          these stories were meant to be told to an audience. Why not add music,
          dance, and performance? Make it memorable and offer a much-needed
          distraction while enhancing the audience's understanding of the gods
          and their functions. Because while parts of it were meant to
          entertain, other parts were functioning to clarify the gods and their
          function. Explaining different rituals and festivals, reminding the
          audience of rituals' importance and origin. They could also be told to
          show proper ethical and religious behavior and offer a new argument in
          an ongoing debate. These myths could also come and go in popularity.
          It depended on what values were most desired at one time.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's look at one of the claims we're presented with in the episode
          now when we're a bit warmed up. Philip Coppens gives us the following
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The ancients say that when they are talking about mythology, it is
            about unrecorded events of their past. According to the Greek myths,
            the child Zeus was nourished on a mixture of honey and milk at the
            udder of the goat. Now around 1900 AD, a chamber of the Dikteon Cave
            was identified by locals as the birthplace of Zeus, and when
            archaeologists went in there, they discovered an alter with the
            remains of numerous religious offerings, amongst them honey and goat
            milk. These remains date back 4,000 years, to the exact period in
            which the ancient Greek stories took place. The question is, is this
            once again a coincidence that modern excavations find remains in
            this cave that match up with what's written in Greek mythology?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          That Zeus was fed milk and honey as an infant isn't anything we need
          to pay much attention to since it's a typical mixture in Greek
          mythology. But is Coppens talking about a real archaeological find?
          Well, here's the thing, it's a bit of yes and no.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is the Dikteon Cave the birthplace of Zeus? As we discussed a moment
          ago, the answer to the question would depend on who told the story and
          at what time. So yes, some accounts mention Dikteon Cave as the
          birthplace of Zeus, but others will tell you that the birth occurred
          in the Idaean Cave over at Mount Ida. If you were to ask the poet,
          Hesiod, the delivery didn't take place in a cave but in the fertile
          lands around the city of Lyctus. The one thing that ties these
          accounts together is that all these locations are on the island of
          Crete, trying to connect the birth of the god to the Minoan cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's suppose that the Dikteon cave is the cave where, what I assume
          was a highly awkward, delivery took place. Do we really know where the
          location of the cave was? And again, we will have different answers
          depending on who we ask. Most famously, the site is associated with
          Psycro Cave. If you had ask those living in the village of
          Palaikastro, the cave is located on the mountain just beside them,
          called Mount Petsofas.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Because that's the thing, the myths could be used to make a specific
          temple or place of offerings more influential. These are just two
          versions that survive to our day, but there probably were other
          locations on Crete with a similar story. Myths in Ancient Greece could
          be used to enhance a city's political, religious, or social status.
          This was not only reserved for locations, but also families could use
          myths to try to strengthen their influence or standing. For example,
          Hippocrates' family was traced back to the deified hero of healing,
          Asclepius.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what about that excavation then and all those finds? I believe
          that Coppens refers to an article by Arthur Evans published in 1897
          called "Further Discoveries of Cretan and Aegean Script: With Libyan
          and Proto-Egyptian Comparisons." As the title alludes to, the paper
          deals with, for 1897, new finds of early types of scripts on Crete.
          One part of the paper deals with a libation table found within the
          Psycro Cave and its small inscription.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're unfamiliar with libation, it is a ritual where a liquid is
          offered to the gods or the dead sometimes. So pouring out a drink for
          one who died is a libation, and it's a ritual found in many different
          religions and locations. We find evidence for it in Sumer, Egypt,
          Greece, and Judaism. In Genesis 35:14, Jacob pours out liquid and oil
          as an offering.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Evans discusses the finds made in the cave up to that point and notes
          that some of the oldest layers date back to the Mycenaean period. This
          would make some artifacts about 4000 years old, give or take a century
          or two. But Evans does not claim that milk and honey have been found
          within the cave, but he does mention that cups and other vessels for
          liquids have been found. That would make sense since it's a libation
          table he is discussing. There are carved out three spots where cups
          would probably be placed. Quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The threefold receptacle of the Diktaean Table suggests some
            interesting analogies with a ritual usage which goes back to the
            earliest religious stratum of Greece; In the case of such primitive
            worship as that of the Shades of the Departed, and again in that of
            the Nymphs, a triple libation was frequently offered.</em
          >" (Evans 1897, p 358)
        </p>
        <p>
          What is this triple libation, then? Evans brings up Homer's Odyssey,
          an example where again, poets, not organized religion, have preserved
          rituals and why they might be performed. If we go to Odeysee book ten
          and line 519, we learn that "Thither, prince, do thou draw nigh, as I
          bid thee, and dig a pit of a cubit's length this way and that, and
          around it pour a libation to all the dead, first with milk and honey,
          thereafter with sweet wine, and in the third place with water."
        </p>
        <p>
          We should note that Evans or later archaeologists never claim that we
          have found residue of this honey-milk mixture within the cave. Evans
          does, though, make a connection between the cave's association being
          the birthplace of Zeus and the libation of milk and honey. So it's
          noted that the cave had an essential religious association with early
          Myccean culture, and would it be that strange if, in later times, the
          myths surrounding the cave changed to fit the current gods.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Coppens's claims are not as bad as they could be. However, he takes
          a very euhemeristic approach to myths and cherry-picks the versions
          that best fit his narrative. But instead of the classical version
          argued by Euhemerus, where the gods have their origin in ordinary men
          that, through history, have evolved into gods. Coppens has a bit of a
          different approach and claims that it is alien visitors that have
          evolved into gods. The cave itself is not evidence that the Greek
          myths are true, as Philip Coppens and the Alien theorist want to
          belive. But could there be evidence for alien visitation within the
          myths themself?

          "<em
            >But Ancient Astronaut Theorists believe this Greek myth is actually
            a metaphor for an extraterrestrial event. They believe the notion of
            gods being vomited up from the belly of their father actually
            describes mutinous aliens being expelled from the mother ship</em
          >." - Narrator
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Anything which is followed up into a living creature will not be
            able to survive for three days it will die from suffocation and will
            begin to decay. So, what we have here is not a creature, but
            something else. It could've been an object, which was clearly of a
            man-made or extraterrestrial origin</em
          >." - Philip Coppens.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what we have here is the story of the origin of the Greek gods,
          with the twist that the gods, of course, are aliens. Claims like these
          make me wonder how people can take these claims seriously. Reading our
          sources, it's pretty clear that authors like Hesiod, Homer, Plato,
          Apollonius, and others describe a man eating his children.
        </p>
        <p>
          But instead of focusing on specific claims, such as whether Cronus was
          a metaphor for a spaceship, I think it better to look deeper into
          Greek religion. If we understand how the Greeks viewed their religion
          and gods, we are better armed to combat these pseudo-scientific
          claims.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's for a moment pretend that we're back in Ancient Greece. Close
          your eyes and picture yourself standing in the bustling Agora of
          Athens. Above us, the magnificent Akropoli can be seen perched atop
          the hill. As we feel the scorching sun beating down on us, we would
          instinctively seek shelter under the cool and shady colonnades that
          line the perimeter of the Agora. Sitting down by one of the fountains
          and maybe trying to listen to one of the philosophers' discussion.
          This is an important place, not only as a meeting spot and a place to
          conduct business but also from a religious and political perspective.
          Even when we now stand on holy ground, people would look at us a bit
          confused if we were to ask what religion they belonged to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ancient Greeks did not have a word for "religion," the closest we
          get to something representing religion would be "in service to the
          gods." This did not mean everyone was supposed to give up their
          worldly possessions and live to serve the gods. With service, the idea
          was more that you behaved with religious correctness and showed proper
          respect toward the gods. You made reasonable requests, gave the gods
          their appropriate gifts, and participated in communal and family
          religious activities and festivals. If done correctly, you would
          accumulate goodwill with the gods serving your house and city.
        </p>
        <p>
          When reading Herodotus writing about the faith of other nations, he
          usually uses the term "to worship the gods." He does not really
          attribute them being to a different religion per se. But when
          discussing the Greek's worship Herodotus, emphasize the common blood,
          language, and temples the Greeks share to differentiate them from
          other peoples' worship.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While we today separate religion and our other spheres, luckily, I
          might add, this was not the case in Greece. Religion was embedded in
          every detail of your daily life. Most things you would participate in
          a day would be accompanied by religious rituals or rules, trade,
          farming, political processes, or any other part was integrated with
          religion. Even the concepts like Atheist did not even exist until the
          5th century BCE, and then the term "Atheos" did refer to a lack of
          relation to the gods.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In retrospect, a Greek worshiper would still have more in common with
          a modern atheist when we look at the religious structure. The Greeks
          did not adhere to any doctrine or creed. You did not have to avoid the
          pleasure of the world since there was no sin or redemption, no eternal
          damnation of fear thereof. There was no hierarchal priesthood that
          would act as a body of power. During the archaic and classical periods
          of Greece, each city would basically have its own versions of the
          myth, gods, and their function. That would change to some degree when
          city-states like Athens and Sparta increased their sphere of
          influence. Even more when Alexander and Macedonians took over Greece
          in the fourth century BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The closest we might get to a holy book would be Herodotus's writings,
          but even then, it was not written in stone. Due to the lack of written
          authority, there were not really things such as heresy since the texts
          were supposed to change due to their oral element. With that said,
          there was, however, a concept called asebeia that could be translated
          to impiety. This could include temple robbery, striking a priest,
          having the wrong ideas, or entering a temple when it was not open to
          the public. According to the prophet Diopeithes asebeia, it could be
          considered "not honour the gods by worshipping them according to
          tradition." While they did not have a concept of sin, their religious
          intolerance game was strong. It was this; for example, Socrates was
          famously put on trial. Athens did have a strict "no new gods" policy
          in place and did have any interest in adding to the existing pantheon.
          Could also be plain xenophobia at play here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, the Greek religion changed, grew, and myths overtook each
          other in importance. Think of Zeus, the big honcho god, that we today
          probably think would be one of the most important gods. But that is
          not really the case. There were few festivals in Zeus' honor, and
          those that existed were of little importance. Very few cities named
          any month after Zeus, and his temples were often located a bit
          outside. But even here, we see an evolution. Zeus did not start as the
          protector of social and moral order and king of the gods. He began as
          a simple weather god, but the story surrounding him grew as time
          passed. Zeus's wife was not Hera from the start either but Dione, a
          name we can find in the Linear-B scripts. Dione's time as Zeus' wife
          was relatively short, and Hera took over during the Mycenaean
          period.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, a plethora of gods have emerged and declined in
          significance. Those who adhere to a particular deity often strive to
          promote their favored god. An example of this can be seen in a hymn
          originating from Delphi, which urges for the constant veneration of
          Dionysos instead of the customary winter-only devotion. It should be
          clear that the gods still had their domains and powers. We also see
          the apparent oppositions that could be used to demonstrate values.
          Take, for example, cases where Athena would best Poseidon. To the
          Greeks, this would be an example of where intelligence beat force. We
          see orderly and disorderly gods. While a good Bacchanalia-style
          festival was welcomed, tidy goods were needed to counterbalance these
          events.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In ancient Greek mythology, the gods were thought to bear a striking
          resemblance to humans, except for having perfectly sculpted physiques.
          Despite their distinct personalities, they were known to display all
          too familiar emotions to us mortals, including envy, vindictiveness,
          self-absorption, timidity, and even brutality. The gods, however, held
          a less-than-flattering view of us, mere mortals, often dismissing us
          as insignificant beings. Furthermore, they were notorious for engaging
          in petty squabbles and disputes amongst themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gods were not worshiped because of their tender love for their
          creation. Maybe they were worshipped out of fear since it could be
          even more dangerous not to honor them properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how do we know what we know about the Greek gods? Well, to some
          extent, it's through the poets; Homer might have had the most
          significant influence. We have a lot of poems and other writings with
          stories dealing with the gods that were used to demonstrate the god's
          origin and purpose of rituals. But we also have the philosophers Plato
          often discussed the gods in his dialogues and used them as examples.
          As we covered, the gods were not separate from everyday life but
          highly incorporated in every aspect. While the written word can tell
          us what some people thought and viewed the gods, we can also use
          sculptures and pottery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially pottery can be very helpful in tracing the popularity of
          the different gods and how ordinary people would have viewed them. So
          by looking at surviving vases, we can see how in 560 BCE, there was a
          shift in what was popular. Motives of Theseus and the Minutar and
          other ideas from the Attic tradition make an entrance. We also see
          Heracles and other pan-Hellenic myths making an entrance. Then around
          480 BCE, these motives start to disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          So is there room for aliens in Greek mythology? Not really. The Alien
          Theorists make their argument work by selecting one account from
          hundreds of different versions. Then claim that this version is the
          only one and leave out all the other contradicting accounts. They
          claim that the people still renowned for their poetry and literature
          would be unable to describe an alien craft if they saw one. So, in the
          end, aliens are incompatible with the ancient Greeks' view of their
          gods and religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          On that bombshell, we will have a short message from our sponsors. But
          when we return, we will be exploring invisibility machines in Greece.
        </p>
        <h2 id="Gyges">Gyges, invisibility devices and moral philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back. We have not gone too far and will remain in Greece for a
          bit longer. Or rather, we will be dealing with Greek writing about
          Lydia, a region now located in modern Turkey. In the show, we hear
          about King Gyges and how he is supposed to have come to power; the
          writers of the show claim that this event occurred in 716 BCE. Quite
          the achievement since Gyges reign was between 680-644 BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          We learn that Gyges was a modest shepherd who was in the service of
          King Candaules. As fate would have it, one day, while he was tending
          to his flock in the fields, a powerful earthquake shook the ground
          beneath his feet, causing a deep chasm to appear before him. Intrigued
          by the unusual occurrence, he descended into the crevice and stumbled
          upon a crypt where he discovered a skeleton adorned with a precious
          gold ring. Without hesitation, Gyges took possession of the ring and
          soon realized that it possessed the extraordinary ability to render
          him invisible. With this new power, Gyges makes his way to the king
          with a plan.

        <p>
          "<em
            >He comes up with a plan. The next time he goes to visit the king he
            brings that ring with him, turns himself invisible, seduces the

        <p>
          "<em
            >When I read stories like Gyges of Lydia, who has found this ring
            which gave him the capability of becoming invisible, then there are
            two things that I think of: one, is it just fantasy or do we have
            another reference here that describes misunderstood technology.
            Because today, researchers at Duke University are trying to develop
            an invisibility cloak.</em
          >" - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gyges is a verified historical figure who once held power over the
          kingdom of Lydia. But how is it with this story? Is it real? In trying
          to answer must delve into the two primary sources of information
          regarding Gyges' history as documented in Greek literature. Let's
          start with one of the older accounts of Greek history writing found in
          Herodotus's "Histories" Book One. Here, we can learn that Candaules
          "then, fell in love with his own wife, so much so that he believed her
          to be by far the most beautiful woman in the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't understand why Herodotus seems to think it's so strange that
          someone would believe their partner to be the most beautiful. Anyway,
          the king is so enamored that he goes to his favorite bodyguard, Gyges;
          yes, here he is, not a shepherd. Candaules tells Gyges that his wife
          is the most beautiful woman on earth. Not wanting to insult his
          employer. I assume that Gyges nods along, saying that she really is
          lovely. Herodotus then gives us a bit of foreshadowing by stating that
          Candaules was "doomed to misfortune" and continues to talk about his
          wife's beauty to Gyges. Claiming that Gyges do not understand, he
          listens but doesn't really get it. Gyges can only truly understand the
          queen's beauty if he sees her naked.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In Herodotus' account, Gyges proclaim, "what an unsound suggestion,
          that I should see my mistress naked!" Gyges proceeded to say that it
          would be against what's right and that he does believe Candaules's
          claims but that seeing the queen naked would be against what's just.
          The king has non of that "Courage, Gyges! Do not be afraid of me."
          Then the king tells the poor bodyguard where to hide to get a good
          look at the queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might suspect, the queen, of course, sees Gyges when he sneaks
          out. But she does not scream or cry. According to Herodotus, it's a
          grand upfront among the Lydians and other foreign countries to be seen
          naked. However, the queen seems to understand that her husband put all
          of this together and crafted a plan. The next day she calls Gyges to
          her and gives him two alternatives. "Now, Gyges, you have two ways
          before you; decide which you will follow. You must either kill
          Candaules and take me and the throne of Lydia for your own, or be
          killed yourself now without more ado; that will prevent you from
          obeying all Candaules' commands in the future and seeing what you
          should not see."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gyges opts for the first alternative, kills Candaules, and takes the
          throne with the queen. The oracle of Delfi later approved Gyges as
          king since the people of Lydia started to revolt and would only follow
          the new king if he was ordained by the oracle.
        </p>
        <p>
          An earlier account is also attributed to Xanthus, the Lydian preserved
          in Nicolaus of Damascus writings during the first century BCE. This
          differs from what we just heard. Here the king does not trust his
          bodyguard Gyges, who is sent out to do impossible tasks. During one of
          the tasks, he sees the queen, falls in love, and tries to seduce her.
          But the queen is uninterested and tells the king to kill Gyges. But a
          slave finds out and warns Gyges, who then counter-attack, kills the
          king, and takes the kingdom after being ordained by the oracle at
          Delfi.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this story differs from Herodutus to some extent, we see two
          things in common. That Gyges starts out as a trusted bodyguard and
          that he, with some help, kills the king and takes over the kingdom
          with the approval of the Gods. One of the key differences is that
          Herodotus goes to great lengths trying to almost make Gyges out to be
          a victim. Reading a bit behind the lines, we can see a victim of fate.
          Herodotus even tells us that the king was destined to fare ill, most
          likely due to his lack of respect for tradition and what's proper and
          just behavior. Since the king show signs of being a tyrant, Gyges has
          to set things right. By following fate, something considered important
          within Greek society, Gyges could be argued to be acting just in his
          regicide. By having this confirmed by the oracles, the new dynasty
          could start.
        </p>
        <p>
          But where does this magic ring come from, then? Because it is not
          mentioned at all in these sources. The alien theorist's account comes
          not from the historic writers but from the philosophical. The account
          is found in Plato's book "The Republic."
        </p>
        <p>
          While the story we heard first appears in the Republic, some crucial
          details are left out. For starters, Plato is telling the story as a
          way to make an argument for what justice is. In the second book of the
          Republic, Plato has Glaucon set up an example. "Let us suppose that
          the just and unjust have two rings, like that of Gyges in the
          well-known story, which make them invisible." The main idea Plato
          wants to discuss in this part is morality and whether acting just has
          intrinsic, instrumental, or both values. Basically, do you only behave
          morally to gain the reputation of being just, or do you behave morally
          because the act is valuable to you?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Socrates claims within the text that acting just has both intrinsic
          and instrumental values. Glaucon uses the example of the invisibility
          rings as a metaphor. Both the just and the unjust get the ability of
          invisibility, nobody can see you, and you can do whatever you want
          without consequence. With this ability, the philosopher argues that
          the just would stop acting appropriately since it would not matter. If
          moral and immoral acts were viewed both as moral, why would anyone act
          morally?
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is our question, and it's why Plato most likely made this
          story of Gyges ring up. We see elements and themes that Plato tends to
          use in other places. The reason why Gyges is turned into a shepherd is
          to really make it clear that the regicide, in this case, is an immoral
          act. Later in the Republic, it becomes clear that different classes
          meeting as equals will destroy an ideal regime. Even the cavern sounds
          much like Platos' cave analogy, where the cave represents a city. The
          ring could be viewed as the power of rhetoric. It could be argued that
          by obtaining the ring, Gyges got the power of poets and philosophers,
          the power that with words changes your appearance; with good rhetoric,
          you can make an unjust action appear in the eyes of the people to be
          just.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Herodotus depicted a character following fate to uphold tradition,
          while Plato created a villain to fulfill that role in his thought
          experiment. Why Plato went with Gyges was probably due to him being a
          character people kind of knew about. We have fragments of a play, the
          author is not entirely known, but Phrynichus or Ion of Chios has been
          suggested. Plato added the "as we all know" to make it more
          believable. Just as many poets started their stories about the gods by
          thanking the muses for the revelation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So what account is correct, then? We have now dealt with three
          versions, and it is a fair question. I think due to the elements Plato
          included in his rendition that we can dismiss it as a philosophical
          thought experiment. Too many details line up with other things Plato
          discusses in the Republic for it to be an accurate account. Herodotus'
          version is the oldest we have preserved, but it contains several
          plotholes and loose ends. I get a feeling that Herodotus was using
          parts he heard from Xanthus and added a few things to highlight values
          he deemed essential in Greek society. Xanthus version, sure, it's not
          the original source we get it in, but it is the most direct and
          straightforward. We can't say currently without more evidence for
          either of the two accounts. What do you think? What version sounds
          more reasonable to you and why.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As we note, however, there is no need for aliens, and neither text
          allows for it to be an extraterrestrial force. Well, if they did not
          travel all this way to pose us with a question regarding moral
          philosophy. But this is how the Alien-theorists misuse ancient
          sources. While they, in this case, didn't make things up, they left
          out the context entirely. Without the context, what they say might
          sound reasonable, but when we look closer at the sources, we learn
          that they rewrote the story to fit their preferred narrative.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          After this quick Break, we will leave the Mediterranean for a trip
          over the Atlantic. Don't worry. We're not heading to Atlantis but to
          Meso-America.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="Voladores">La Danza de los Voladores</h2>
        <p>
          We're moving on from classical Greece and exploring something new on
          the show today. Our destination is Meso-America, where we'll
          investigate the Danza de los Voladores, also known as the Ceremony of
          the Fliers. This ritual has managed to survive for over ten centuries
          against all odds. It is still performed today by various indigenous
          groups in Mexico, including the Totonaucs, Nahua, Otom&iacute;, and
          Huastec. We also see this performance among the Maya in Guatemala and
          the Pipil in Nicaragua.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ceremony has various forms depending on who and when it is
          performed. However, in the show Ancient Aliens, they incorrectly claim
          that there is only one authoritative version of this ritual. The truth
          is that there are multiple versions. The most known version of the
          performance can be witnessed in Veracruz or Hildalgo, consisting of
          five people. A pole is raised on the square during this ceremony,
          usually near the local church. The pole's height varies but is rarely
          over 30 meters. At the top of the pole is a square wooden platform and
          a rotating cylinder called a tecomate. The ceremony leader stands on
          the tecomate, equipped with a flute known as tapitzalli and a drum
          called huehuetl in Nahuatl. The leader plays these instruments
          simultaneously while performing on top of the tecomate. The leader is
          not secured by ropes, but the flyers are tied to the platform with
          belts. The flyers go down headfirst with their arms outstretched,
          somersault close to the ground and land on their feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple versions of the dance, including some modified to
          align with Christian beliefs. The dance is organized into various
          sonnets and is performed to somewhat adhere to a Catholic storyline.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is the Ancient Alien claim regarding this ceremony? Let's
          tune in and hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Totonac people who practice this ceremony today claim it is a
          dance that was invented 500 years ago as a plea to the gods to end a
          severe drought. But could this ancient ritual have different, perhaps
          otherworldly origins?" - Narrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legend that the Narrator refers to seems to originate in
          Coatzintla and is supposed to take place around 450 years ago. But
          they are leaving out some key elements, such as the people were
          supposed to cut down the tallest and strongest tree to symbolize the
          tree of life. Performing on top of the tree of life would increase the
          chance of the Sun God to hear the prayers and be filled with so much
          joy and fervor that he would restore the luscious vegetation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But then you have other variations; in Cuacuila, the story is set in
          ancient times long ago. There the flyers prepare for a ceremony to
          remove the drought, but when performing it, they fly away out into the
          sea and return 12 days later in the spiritual form of rain. But it
          almost seems to backfire since the rain is too much and too heavy. In
          fact, it did not stop for eight days, and when the villagers asked
          what had happened, the elders told them that these flyers had
          transformed into rain gods.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We can find documented variations of this ritual going back to 1528
          when Fern&aacute;ndez de Oviedo witnessed one version celebrated
          during the cocoa harvest by the Pipil (or Nahua) people. It was a
          little bit different compared to what we see celebrated today by the
          Totonaucs. There was a 17-meter pole that had on top an image of the
          cocoa god, de Oviedo, referring to this god as Cac&aacute;guat. Two
          boys around seven years old were tied to the pole and circled down as
          ten musicians played. The boy was wearing bird masks and was equipped
          with different accessories. This version could be interpreted as a
          representation of the accent the cacao diety made from the underworld
          up to the heavens. The rite was supposed to take place both at the
          start of the harvest and at the end of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It did not, however, take long after the Spanish arrival for the
          indigenous people to start attempting to preserve their culture by
          describing it as something else to the Spanish Chronicles. In the
          writings of Diego Dur&aacute;n in 1560, for example, he describes this
          festival. But instead of attributing it to a deity, he is told that
          this is a game they do as a sort of sport. The chronicler is even
          putting this in the section of his book where he deals with the
          amusements and sports of the people he met in Central Mexico. An
          exciting part of Diego Dur&aacute;n's narrative is that he describes
          the flyers as being dressed as birds and monkeys. This rite can also
          be found among the K'iche' Mayans in Guatemala, but then the dancers
          are dressed as monkeys.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, we have access to more than just written accounts from
          Spanish chroniclers regarding understanding the Voladores ritual.
          Indigenous people of Central America have also depicted elements of
          the ceremony in codices from the colonial period, such as the Porfirio
          D&iacute;az Codex and the Fern&aacute;ndez Leal Codex. These beautiful
          drawings attest to the ritual's importance. But what is the origin and
          meaning of the Valadores ceremony according to the ancient astronaut
          theorists?
        </p>
        <p>
          "According to Ancient Astronaut Theorists, the Voladores ritual is a
          reenactment of a close encounter with alien visitors in the distant
          past. They believe extraterrestrials descended upon the flat
          mountaintops of the Palpa region in Peru around 500 AD, dropping from
          their aircraft and gliding down to Earth in spiraling circles." -
          Narrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Voladores ritual was very technological, as in, you know, these
          beings descending from the sky and the circle signifying arrival of
          the gods. Where does that flying or descending gods motif originate?
          Our ancestors saw something because why would you hurl yourself from a
          100-foot pole out of nothing, to imitate a bird? Birds are not that
          important. Something very significant happened." - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have to say that it is a brave attempt trying to connect the ritual
          to the Nazca lines and the Palpa region. To start, the ceremony is
          older than 500 CE, meaning the origin is not likely related to the
          Nazca lines since they, in fact, are from around 500 CE. Secondly, as
          we noted throughout this episode. There is not a meaning. The origin
          and reason will vary depending on who you ask and when you ask them.
          We have noted that this ritual can be found from Guatemala to Mexico,
          connected to different gods at different times. For simplicity, we can
          have a quick glance around the ideas regarding the Totonaucs view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the research from Martha Narjera, we can read the ritual as
          representations of birds or spirits of the forest. The first reading
          could represent eagles and that the dance represents the dead warriors
          accompanying the sun across the sky. There could be, however, another
          symbology within this ritual and narrative. Luisa Villani is making a
          good case that the dance performed in El Tajin symbolizes hurricanes
          and weather.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As we note with Greek myths, the myth of Mesoamerica only seems to
          contain alien interference if you leave out significant bits of them.
          But the aliens vanish when looking at the legends in context with
          their history, religious connections, and foundation in a living
          society. However, it amply shows how the alien theory is robbing every
          one of us. Not to say the least how it robs indigenous people of their
          heritage and traditions, nearly extinct traditions. This is close to a
          similar attempt to remove these ideas from the hands of their rightful
          owners.
