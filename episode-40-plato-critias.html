          It's summertime, so why not take a breath and relax. While examining
          pseudo-scientific claims is important, it's good to remember to take a
          breath and relax. It is also essential to look at the source material
          for the claims we investigate. So we will combine these things and
          have a bit of summer reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode is different since we will spend time reading Plato's
          work "Critias" from start to finish. As you might know, this is the
          source for the Atlantis story, and you will get it uncensored in all
          its glory.
        </p>
        <p>
          So take a break, have some coffee, and let's tune in to the ongoing
          lecture from Plato.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is episode 40, and I'm your host, Fredrik. This will be a bit of
          a different episode. It will actually not be like anything we have
          done before. Exciting, isn&rsquo;t it? As you might know, or not, I
          live in Sweden, and the summer is in full swing here. This, of course,
          means that it&rsquo;s vacation time with travel and all of that. To
          keep the schedule, I needed to resort to this bank episode, but it
          will give you a lot of great insights for future and past episodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          So from the title, I assume that you know this will be about Atlantis,
          but it will not be as usual. No, instead of talking about the text
          generally, we will bother to read it. Something I think Hancock,
          Coresetti, and Von D&auml;niken have not done. So this episode will be
          a reading of Plato's book Critias. I&rsquo;ve mainly used the 1892
          release since it&rsquo;s firmly within the public domain, translated
          by B. Jowett. But since this translation is over a hundred years old,
          I&rsquo;ve rewritten some parts based on later translations. I&rsquo;m
          not an expert in ancient Greek. I don&rsquo;t speak it at all, as a
          matter of fact. But based on the different translations I&rsquo;ve
          read, I&rsquo;d say that this is a reasonably accurate representation
          of Plato's idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, I&rsquo;ve read even more studies on the book trying to
          represent what&rsquo;s said in the text with the knowledge we have
          today. Enough on this right now. If you want to check my work, that is
          possible. Since you can find sources, resources, and reading
          suggestions on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also
          find contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions.
          And if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Now that we have finished our preparations let's dig into the episode.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: justify" id="intro">Introduction to the book</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >Before dealing with the story itself, we need to set the mood and a
            good picture. I'd also recommend listening to episode 39, "Among
            gods, aliens and poets," before this one since it deals with how the
            Greeks viewed myths. Critias Dialog is the second book in an
            uncompleted trilogy where the events occur the day after Plato's
            dialog "The Republic." In this work, Plato tries to answer two
            central questions. "What is justice" and "is a just person more
            happy in life than a unjust person." To answer this, an imaginary
            city is constructed with words, and the characters name it
            Kallipolis.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >But in the first book of the trilogy "Timeus," the attendants from
            the previous night, Critias, Socrates, Hermocrates, and Timaeus,
            meet up in the courtyard of a house in Athens. Plato does not state
            whose house this is, but from the words he uses, it's often assumed
            to belong to Critias. The book starts with Plato assigning each
            attendant a turn order for presentations, Timeus first, Critias
            second, and Hermocrates third.&nbsp;</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >Plato also summarises the virtues he had attributed to his perfect
            society Kallipolis and wishes it was possible to see this city in
            motion. Timeus say that Critias happened to know about a state that
            was just like Kallipolis. Critias gives the short version of the
            Atlantis story and says he will tell more when it's his turn as a
            way to repay Soctates for yesterday's speech. We also learn that
            Critias heard this story when he was ten told by his grandfather
            during the Apaturia. This was a festival with a storytelling
            competition.&nbsp; Timeus, after this teaser, proceeds with his talk
            on the cosmic origin and the creation of man.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >So it's at the end of Timeus talk our story today starts. A final
            comment, within the text, we will encounter a measurement called
            Stadia or Stadion. Translated to metrics, a stadia is between 150 to
            200 meters. And without further ado, we will take our places and
            listen to the conversation.&nbsp;</span

          ><span style="color: #0e101a">
            And there I&rsquo;ve come to a pleasing end of my account, Socrates.
            It is like a good rest after a long journey, so pleasing to me is
            liberation from this long speech! I offer my prayer to the god who
            has just been created in my speech (though, of course, he was
            created long ago, in fact) is that for our sakes, he may keep safe
            everything that was well said and that if we inadvertently struck a
            false note he will impose the appropriate penalty &mdash; and the
            proper sentence when someone is out of tune is to make him
            harmonious. I pray for the gift of knowledge, the most perfect and
            effective medicine, so that in the future, any account we give of
            the creation of gods may be accurate. And now, having offered my
            prayer, I now deliver the argument to Critias, who will speak next
            according to our agreement.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >CRITIAS: And I, Timaeus, accept the trust, and as you at first said
            that you were going to speak of high matters and begged that some
            forbearance might be shown to you, I too ask the same or greater
            tolerance for what I am about to say. And although I very well know
            that my request may appear to be somewhat ambitious and
            discourteous, I must make it nevertheless. For will any man of sense
            deny that you have spoken well? I can only attempt to show that I
            ought to have more indulgence than you because my theme is more
            complex. You see, Timaeus, it's easier for someone to appear
            competent speaking to humans about gods than talking about mortal
            men. When the audience's condition is one of inexperience and
            blatant ignorance of a topic, it's effortless for someone to address
            it &mdash; and we all know how we're placed when the issue is the
            gods.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >But I would like to clarify my meaning if you allow me. All that is
            said by any of us can only be imitation and representation. For if
            we consider the likenesses that painters make of bodies divine and
            heavenly, and the different degrees of gratification with which the
            eye of the spectator receives them, we shall see that we are
            satisfied with the artist who is able in any degree to imitate the
            earth and its mountains, and the rivers, and the woods, and the
            universe, and the things that are and move therein, and further,
            that knowing nothing precise about such matters, we do not examine
            or analyze the painting; all that is required is a sort of dark and
            deceptive mode of shadowing them forth. But when a person endeavors
            to paint the human form, we are quick at finding defects, and our
            familiar knowledge makes us severe judges of anyone who does not
            render every point of similarity. And we may observe the same thing
            happen in discourse; we are satisfied with a picture of divine and
            heavenly things with a tiny likeness to them. Still, we are more
            precise in our criticism of mortal and human things. Wherefore if I
            cannot express my meaning at the moment of speaking, you must excuse
            me, considering that to form approved likenesses of human things is
            the reverse of easy. This is what I want to suggest to you and at
            the same time to beg, Socrates, that I may have not less but more
            leniency given to me in what I am about to say. A favor, if I am
            right in asking, I hope you will be ready to grant.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >SOCRATES: Certainly, Critias, we will grant your request, and we
            will grant the same by anticipation to Hermocrates, as well as to
            you and Timaeus; for I have no doubt that when his turn comes to a
            bit of while hence, he will make the same request which you have
            made. In order that he may provide himself with a fresh beginning
            and not be compelled to repeat the same things, let him understand
            that the indulgence is already extended by anticipation to him. And
            now, friend Critias, I will announce the judgment of the theatre.
            They believe that the last performer was wonderfully successful and
            that you will need much indulgence before you can take his
            place.</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >HERMOCRATES: The warning, Socrates, which you have addressed to
            him, I must also take to myself. But remember, Critias, that faint
            heart never yet raised a trophy. Therefore, you must go and attack
            the argument like a man. First, invoke Apollo and the Muses, and
            then let us hear you sound the praises and show forth the virtues of
            your ancient citizens.</span

            another in front of you, have not lost heart as yet; the gravity of
            the situation will soon be revealed to you; meanwhile, I accept your
            exhortations and encouragements. But besides the gods, goddesses,
            and the muses whom you have mentioned, I would especially invoke
            Memory; for all the essential part of my discourse is dependent on
            her favor, and if I can recollect and recite enough of what was said
            by the priests and brought here by Solon, I doubt not that I shall
            satisfy the requirements of this theatre. And now, making no more
            excuses, I will proceed.</span

            >First, let me begin by observing that nine thousand was the sum of
            years that had elapsed since the war which was said to have taken
            place between those who dwelt outside the pillars of Heracles and
            all who lived within them; I will describe this war. Of the
            combatants on the one side, the city of Athens was reported to have
            been the leader and to have fought out the war; the combatants on
            the other side were commanded by the kings of Atlantis, an island
            which, as we said, was once larger than Libya and Asia. However,
            earthquakes have caused it to sink by now, leaving behind
            unnavigable mud, which obstructs those who sail out there into the
            ocean. The progress of history will unfold the various nations of
            barbarians (non-Greeks) and families of Hellenes (Greek families),
            which then existed as they successively appeared on the scene.
            Still, I must first describe the Athenians of that day and their
            enemies who fought with them and then the respective powers and
            governments of the two kingdoms. Let us give precedence to
            Athens.</span

            >In the old days, the gods distributed the whole earth among
            themselves. There was no quarreling; after all, it makes no sense
            for the gods not to know what is appropriate for each of them. Since
            they do have such knowledge, it is illogical to believe that they
            would dispute claims and try to gain what correctly belonged to
            another one of them. They all of them, by just distribution,
            obtained what they wanted, and created communities in these lands,
            and having done so, began to look after us, his property and
            creatures, as shepherds tend their flocks, except, only that they
            did not use blows or physical force, as shepherds do, but governed
            us like the captain from the stern of the vessel, which is an easy
            way of guiding animals, holding our souls by the rudder of
            persuasion according to their own pleasure;&mdash;thus did they
            guide all mortal creatures.&nbsp;</span

            >Now different gods had their allotments in different places, which
            they set in order. Hephaestus and Athene, who were brother and
            sister and sprang from the same father, also have a similar nature
            and are united in the love of philosophy and art. Both obtained
            Atens to share, an area naturally adapted for wisdom and courage.
            They created brave men out of the soil and put into their minds how
            to structure the political system.&nbsp;</span

            >Although only&nbsp; the names of these initial Athenians have been
            preserved, the destruction of their successors and a long extension
            of time have erased their accomplishments. For when there were any
            survivors, as I have already said, they were men who dwelt in the
            mountains. They were ignorant of the art of writing and had heard
            only the names of the chiefs of the land but very little about their
            actions. They were content to name their children after their
            forefathers. Still, they were unaware of their bravery and rituals,
            save for the odd obscure tale about this or that. As they and their
            children lacked the necessities of life for many generations, they
            directed their attention to the supply of their wants. Of them, they
            conversed to the neglect of events that had happened in times long
            past. Mythology and the inquiry into antiquity are first introduced
            into cities when they begin to have leisure. When they see that the
            necessaries of life have already been provided, but not
            before.&nbsp;</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >And this is the reason why the names of the ancients have been
            preserved to us and not their actions. The proof I have is that,
            according to Solon, the account of the war those priests gave
            included not only most of the names of Cecrops, Erechtheus,
            Erichthonius, Erysichthon, and the other predecessors of Theseus but
            also attributed most of their achievements to each of them by name,
            and did the same for their wives. Another factor pertinent to how
            the goddess is depicted is that, according to Solon, women and men
            trained for the military at this time. Because of this custom,
            people started to picture the goddess wearing armor. It served as a
            reminder that both sexes of social creatures are equally suited by
            nature to practice the virtue unique to their species.</span

            >Now the country was inhabited in those days by various classes of
            citizens. There were artisans, and there were husbandmen, and there
            was also a warrior class initially set apart by divine men. The
            latter dwelt by themselves and had all things suitable for nurture
            and education; neither had any of them anything of their own. They
            regarded all they had as common property, nor did they claim to
            receive of the other citizens' anything more than their necessary
            food. And they practiced all the pursuits we described yesterday as
            those of our imaginary guardians.&nbsp;</span

            >Concerning the country, the Egyptian priests said what is not only
            probable but manifestly true, that the boundaries were in those days
            fixed by the Isthmus and that in the direction of the continent.
            They extended as far as the heights of Cithaeron and Parnes. The
            boundary line came down toward the sea, with the district of Oropus
            on the right and the river Asopus as the border on the left. The
            land was the best in the world and was, therefore, able to support a
            vast army raised from the surrounding people in those days. Even the
            remnant of Attica, which now exists, may compete with any region in
            the world for the variety and excellence of its fruits and the
            suitableness of its pastures to every animal, which proves what I am
            saying. Still, in those days, the country was fair as now and
            yielded far more abundant produce.</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >Why should we believe this image? Why is it accurate to refer to
            the soil of contemporary Attica as a vestige of that soil? Attica is
            merely a promontory that sticks out into the sea from the rest of
            the mainland and is surrounded by a seabed that drops off abruptly
            to a significant depth close to the shore. Many great deluges have
            occurred during these nine thousand years, for this is the number of
            years that have elapsed since the time of which I am speaking. And
            during all this time and through so many changes, there has never
            been any considerable accumulation of the soil coming down from the
            mountains, as in other places. But the earth has fallen away all
            around and sunk out of sight. The consequence is that in comparison
            to what then was, there are remaining only the bones of the wasted
            body, as they may be called, as in the case of small islands, all
            the more affluent and softer parts of the soil having fallen away,
            and the mere skeleton of the land being left.&nbsp;</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >But in the primitive state of the country, its mountains were high
            hills covered with soil, and the plains, we named the Stony Fields
            (Phelleus), were full of rich earth, and there was abundant wood in
            the mountains. Of this last, the traces still remain, for although
            some of the mountains now only afford sustenance to bees, not so
            very long ago, there were still to be seen roofs of timber cut from
            trees growing there, which were of a size sufficient to cover the
            largest houses; and there were many other high trees, cultivated by
            man and bearing an abundance of food for cattle. Moreover, the land
            reaped the benefit provided by Zeus of the annual rainfall. Not as
            now losing the water which flows off the bare earth into the sea,
            but, having an abundant supply in all places, and receiving it into
            herself and treasuring it up in the compact clay soil, it let off
            into the hollows the streams which it absorbed from the heights,
            providing everywhere abundant fountains and rivers. At the locations
            of historical springs, there are still shrines from the past that
            serve as reminders of the authenticity of this story of the
            country.</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >Such was the natural state of the country, which was cultivated, as
            we may well believe, by genuine farmers, who made farming their
            business. They were lovers of honor and of a noble nature. They had
            the best soil in the world, an abundance of water, and in the heaven
            above, an excellently attempered climate. Now the city in those days
            was arranged like this. First, the Acropolis was different compared
            to now. The fact is that a single night of excessive rain washed
            away the earth and laid the Acropolis bare. At the same time, there
            were earthquakes. Then an extraordinary inundation occurred, the
            third before the great destruction of Deucalion, the Greeks
            ancestor. But in primitive times, the hill of the Acropolis extended
            to the Eridanus and Ilissus. It included the Pnyx on one side and
            the Lycabettus as a boundary on the opposite side to the Pnyx. It
            was all well covered with soil, and level at the top, except in one
            or two places. Outside the Acropolis and under the sides of the hill
            dwelt the artisans and the farmers working the ground nearby.</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >The warrior class dwelt by themselves around the temples of Athene
            and Hephaestus at the summit, which they had enclosed with a single
            fence like the garden of a single house. On the north side, they had
            public buildings and erected dining halls to use during the winter.
            They had all the facilities which they needed for their everyday
            life. The temples were not adorned with gold and silver, for they
            did not use the metals for any purpose. They took a middle course
            between meanness and ostentation. They built moderate houses where
            they and their descendants could grow old and bequeath similar homes
            to others just like themselves. But in the summertime, they left
            their gardens and gymnasia and dining halls, and then the southern
            side of the hill was used by them for the same purpose. Where the
            Acropolis now is, there was a single fountain, which was choked by
            the earthquake, and has left only a few small streams which still
            exist in the vicinity. Still, in those days, the fountain gave an
            abundant water supply for all and had a suitable temperature in
            summer and winter.&nbsp;</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">

            >This is how they dwelt, being the guardians of their own citizens
            and the leaders of the Greeks, who were their willing followers. And
            they took care to preserve the same number of men and women through
            all time, being so many as were required for warlike purposes, then
            as now&mdash;about twenty thousand. Such were the ancient Athenians,
            and after this manner, they righteously administered their own land
            and the rest of Greece; they were renowned all over Europe and Asia
            for the beauty of their persons, and for the many virtues of their
            souls and of all men who lived in those days they were the most
            illustrious. And next, if I have not forgotten what I heard as a
            child, I will impart the character and origin of Athens's enemies.
            Friends should not keep their stories to themselves but have them in
            common.</span

            >Yet, before proceeding further in the narrative, I ought to warn
            you that you must not be surprised if you should perhaps hear Greek
            names given to foreigners and non-Greeks. I will tell you the reason
            for this: Solon, who intended to use the tale for his poem, enquired
            into the meaning of the names and found that the early Egyptians, in
            writing them down, had translated them into their own language and
            he recovered the meaning of the several names and when copying them
            out again translated them into our language. My great-grandfather,
            Dropides, had the original writing, which is still in my possession,
            and was carefully studied by me as a child. Therefore if you hear
            names such as are used in this country, you must not be surprised,
            for I have told how they came to be introduced. The tale, which was
            of great length, began as follows:&mdash;</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >I have before remarked in speaking of the allotments of the gods
            that they distributed the whole earth into portions differing in
            extent and made temples and instituted sacrifices for themselves.
            And Poseidon, receiving the island of Atlantis for his lot, begat
            children by a mortal woman and settled them in a part of the island,
            which I will describe. Looking towards the sea, but in the center of
            the whole island, there was a plain that is said to have been the
            fairest of all plains and very fertile. Near the plain, still in the
            center of the island at a distance of about fifty stadia, there was
            a mountain not very high on any side. In this mountain, there dwelt
            one of the earth-born primeval men of that country, whose name was
            Evenor. He had a wife named Leucippe, and they had an only daughter
            called Cleito. The maiden had already reached womanhood when her
            father and mother died; Poseidon fell in love with and had
            intercourse with her. He separated the hill where she lived from the
            surrounding area to create a defense for his concubine. Surrounding
            it by progressively larger concentric rings made up intermittently
            of land and water. He created rings equally spaced from the center,
            with two rings made of land and three of water. Each had its
            circumference equidistant every way from the center so that no man
            could get to the island, for ships and voyages were not as
            yet.&nbsp;</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >Being a god, Poseidon found no difficulty making special
            arrangements for the center island, bringing up two springs of water
            from beneath the earth, one of warm water and the other of
            cold.&nbsp; Making every variety of food spring up abundantly from
            the soil. He also begat and brought up five pairs of twin male
            children, and dividing the island of Atlantis into ten portions, he
            gave to the first-born of the eldest pair his mother's dwelling and
            the surrounding allotment, which was the largest and best, and made
            the child the king over the rest. He made the others into princes
            and gave them rule over many men and a large territory.&nbsp;</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >And he named them all; the eldest, the first king, he named Atlas;
            after him, the whole island and the ocean were called Atlantic. To
            his twin brother, who was born after him, and obtained as his lot
            the extremity of the island towards the pillars of Heracles, facing
            the country which is now called the region of Gades in that part of
            the world, he gave the name which in the Hellenic language is
            Eumelus, in the language of the country which is named after him,
            Gadeirus. Of the second pair of twins, he called one Ampheres and
            the other Evaemon. To the elder of the third pair of twins, he named
            Mneseus and Autochthon to the one who followed him. Of the fourth
            pair of twins, he called the elder Elasippus and the younger Mestor.
            And of the fifth pair, he gave the elder the name of Azaes and to
            the younger that of Diaprepes. So all his sons and their descendants
            lived there for many generations. In addition to ruling over
            numerous other islands in the ocean, they also, as I said before,
            governed all the land this side of the Pillars of Heracles up to
            Egypt and Etruria.</span

        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <span style="color: #0e101a"
            >Now Atlas had a numerous and honorable family, and they retained
            the kingdom, the eldest son handing it on to his eldest for many
            generations. They had such an amount of wealth as was never before
            possessed by kings and potentates and is not likely ever to be
            again. They were furnished with everything they needed, both in the
            city and country. Because of the greatness of their empire, many
            things were brought to them from foreign countries, and the island
            itself provided most of what was required by them for the use of
            life. In the first place, they dug out of the earth whatever was to
            be found there, solid as well as fusile, and that which is now only
            a name and was then something more than a name, orichalcum, was dug
            out of the earth in many parts of the island, being more precious in
            those days than anything except gold. There was abundant wood for
            carpenter's work and sufficient maintenance for tame and wild
            animals.</span

            the god and their ancestors, which they continued to ornament in
            successive generations. Every king surpassed the one who went before

            passage from the sea up to this, which became a harbor, and leaving
            an opening sufficient to enable the largest vessels to sail.
            Moreover, they divided at the bridges the zones of land which parted
            the zones of the sea, leaving room for a single trireme to pass out
            of one zone into another, and they covered over the channels to

            in. The stone used in the work they quarried from underneath the
            center island, and from underneath the zones, on the outer and inner
            sides. One kind was white, another black, and a third red, and as
            they quarried, they simultaneously hollowed out double docks, having
            roofs formed out of the native rock. Some of their buildings were
            simple, but in others, they put together different stones, varying
            the color to please the eye and to be a natural source of delight.
            The entirety of the wall going around the outer ring was covered
            with a paste made out of brass or bronce. The next wall was coated

            this:&mdash;In the center was a sacrosanct temple dedicated to
            Cleito and Poseidon, surrounded by a low wall of gold. This was the
            spot where the family of the ten princes first saw the light.
            Thither the people annually brought the fruits of the earth in their
            season from all the ten portions, to be an offering to each of the
            ten. Here was Poseidon's own temple, a stadium in length, half a
            stadium in width, and of a proportionate height, with a strange
            non-Greek appearance. All the outside of the temple, except for the
            pinnacles, they covered with silver and the pinnacles with gold. In
            the temple's interior, the roof was of ivory, curiously wrought
            everywhere with gold, silver, and orichalcum. All the other parts,
            walls, pillars, and floor, were coated with orichalcum. In the
            temple, statues of gold were placed. One depicted Poseidon standing
            in a chariot drawn by six winged horses and of such a size that he
            touched the roof of the building with his head. Around him were a
            hundred Nereids riding on dolphins, for such was thought to be the
            number of them by the men of those days. There were also in the
            interior of the temple other images which had been dedicated by
            private persons.&nbsp;</span

            other great offerings of kings and private persons, coming both from
            the city itself and the foreign cities over which they held sway.
            There was an altar too, which in size and workmanship corresponded
            to this magnificence, and the palaces, in like manner, answered to
            the kingdom's greatness and the temple's glory.</span

            suited in respect of both the taste and the water's quality. They
            constructed buildings around them and planted suitable trees. Also,
            they made cisterns, some open to the heaven, others roofed over, to
            be used in winter as warm baths. There were the kings' baths and the
            baths of private persons, which were kept apart. There were also
            separate baths for women, horses, and cattle, and each was
            appropriately organized. Of the water which ran off, they carried
            some to the grove of Poseidon, where we're growing all manner of
            trees of incredible height and beauty, owing to the excellence of
            the soil. At the same time, the remainder was conveyed by aqueducts

            largest island, there was constructed a Hippodrome. In width and in
            length allowed to extend all around the island for horses to race
            in. Also, there were guard houses at intervals for the guards, the
            more trusted of whom were appointed to keep watch in the lesser
            zone, which was nearer the Acropolis, while the most trusted of all
            had houses given them within the citadel, near the persons of the
            kings. The docks were full of triremes and naval stores, and

            kings through long ages. The entire area was extremely high, with
            sheer cliffs along the shoreline; there was nothing but a plain
            close to the city, encircled by mountains descending to the sea. The
            plain, which stretched 3,000 stades in one direction and 2,000
            stades inland from the sea, was uniformly flat and essentially
            oblong-shaped. The island's entire area facing south was protected
            from the northern winds. The mountains surrounding the plains were
            famous in those days for their vast numbers, size, and beauty. It
            said that no mountains today could compete with these. In the
            mountains, there were numerous prosperous villages with rural
            populations, rivers, lakes, and meadows that provided food for all
            species of animals, both domestic and wild, and there was an
            abundance of timber of different types, more than enough for any
            task or occasion.</span

            ages. As I mentioned, the plateau was mainly rectangular and oblong,
            and where falling out of the straight line followed the circular
            ditch. This ditch's depth, width, and length were incredible and
            gave the impression that it could never have been created by man.
            Nevertheless, I must say what I was told. It was excavated to a
            depth of a hundred feet, and its breadth was a stadium everywhere;
            it was carried round the whole of the plain and was ten thousand
            stadia long. It received the streams that came down from the
            mountains and winded around the plateau and then circulated the
            city, washing any discharge into the sea.&nbsp;</span

            then, they had brought the wood from the mountains to the city. They
            conveyed the fruits of the earth in ships, cutting transverse
            passages from one canal into another and to the town. Twice in a
            year, they were able to harvest their crops. In the winter, they
            benefited from the rains provided by Zeus, and in summer, the water

            number of men living in the plain who were to be available for
            military service. Naturally, there were a large number of men from
            the mountains and the rest of the country, and they were all
            assigned to these plots and their commanders, district by district
            and village by village. The leader was required to furnish for the
            war the sixth portion of a war chariot, making a total of ten
            thousand chariots; also two horses and riders for them, and a pair
            of chariot horses without a seat, accompanied by a horseman who
            could fight on foot carrying a small shield, and having a charioteer
            who stood behind the man-at-arms to guide the two horses; also, he
            was bound to furnish two hoplites, two archers, two slingers, three
            stone-shooters and three javelin-men, who were light-armed, and four
            sailors to make up the complement of twelve hundred ships. Such was
            the military order of the royal city. The order of the other nine

            He had absolute control of the citizens and, in most cases, of the
            laws, punishing and slaying whomsoever he would. But among the kings
            themself, they were ruled by the laws and command of Poseidon, as
            passed down to them by tradition. The first kings inscribed the
            rules on a pillar of orichalcum, which was situated in the middle of
            the island at the temple of Poseidon. The kings were gathered
            together there every fifth and every sixth year alternately, thus
            giving equal honor to the odd and to the even number. And when they
            were gathered together, they only discussed matters of general
            interest. But they also tried testing each other to see if any of
            the kings had transgressed against the rules. If that happened, they
            would try the offender.</span

            kept. When the ten kings were alone at the temple, they would pray
            to Poseidon, asking permission to capture one sacrificial bull that
            would please the god. Armed with sticks and rope, since metal
            weapons were not allowed. When they had caught one, they took it to
            the temple and the stele, where they cut the throat above the stele
            and let the blood wash over the inscriptions. It was not only the
            laws written on the pillar but also a wove that would call down a
            horrible curse on anyone who broke the laws inscribed.</span

            bowl of wine, and cast in a clot of blood for each of them. The rest
            of the bull was put in the fire after purifying the column all
            around. Then they drew from the bowl in golden cups and poured a
            libation of blood and wine on the fire. They swore that they would
            judge according to the pillar's laws and punish those who had
            transgressed them at any point. For the future, they would not, if
            they could help, offend against the writing on the pillar, and would
            neither command others nor obey any ruler who commanded them, to act
            otherwise than according to the laws of their father, Poseidon. This
            was the prayer that each of them offered up for himself and his
            descendants while drinking and dedicating the cup out of which he
            drank to the god Poseidon. After they had supped and satisfied their
            needs, when darkness came on and the fire about the sacrifice was
            cold, they all put on the most beautiful azure robes. Then while
            sitting on the ground, at night, over the embers of the sacrifices
            by which they had sworn, after turning out the light in the whole
            temple. The kings received and gave judgment if any of them had an
            accusation to bring against anyone. When they had given judgment, at
            daybreak they wrote down their sentences on a golden tablet. They
            dedicated it together with their robes to be a memorial.</span

            rescue if anyone in any of their cities attempted to overthrow the
            royal house. As their ancestors, they were to deliberate in common
            about war and other matters, giving supremacy to the descendants of
            Atlas. And the king could not sentence his relatives to death unless

            Atlantis. According to the story, the god assembled this force and
            sent it against certain regions for the reasons listed below. For
            many generations, as long as Poseidon's spirit was strong in them,
            they followed the laws and got along well with the gods, who were
            their relatives. The people stuck to principles they perceived as
            true and perfectly wise. Due to their practical manner and in which
            they reacted to changes in life, they looked down on everything
            except virtue. The people of Atlantis&nbsp; saw their prosperity as
            trivial and could easily bore the burden, as one might say, of the
            amount of gold and other possessions. Even if they had large amounts
            of wealth and luxury, they were not overcome with greed and
            drunkenness. With sober eyes, they saw that while prosperity and
            wealth are good, it&rsquo;s better with friendship and virtue. That
            wealth might disappear, and friendships wither from materialistic
            goals and ambitions.</span

            heavy load of their prosperity. Corruption grew among them. Anyone

            to destroy the grandest of their valuables. However, those blind to
            the true way to happiness would see this as the Atlantians finally
            having the most desirable and enviable life. When the noble
            reasoning was gone, the Atlanteans got infected by greed and a
            thirst for power.</span

            >Zeus, the ruler of the gods, who govern by law, was bestowed with
            the eyes to see these types of things. He could see the rot taking
            hold of the divine bloodline and wanted to punish them. Bring by
            punishment more harmony into the life of the people. Zeus summoned
            all the gods for a meeting in one of the most beautiful halls in his
            home. This place is located in the center of the universe and has a
            view of the whole creation. When the gods had taken their seats,

            >Well, what Zeus said, we don&rsquo;t know. Plato never finished
            this story or the third book in the series, which would have been
            the speech from Hermocrates. But I&rsquo;m sure that the end is that
            the Atlanteans win over Atlantis due to their virtues but that the
            gods ultimately punish everyone with a deluge. But this story will
            serve us well in the next episode, where we will deal with Jimmi
            Corsetti's claims about the location of Atlantis. See, there was a
            grander plan with this all along.</span

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.
