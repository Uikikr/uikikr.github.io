          <em>
            Next to a small village in Bosnia there is what some believe is the
            world's oldest and largest pyramid. Sitting there forgotten for
            millennials until one man discovered them again. Or did he?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Hi, hello and v&auml;lkommen to digging up ancient aliens. This is the
          podcast where we examine the TV-show Ancient Aliens. Do their claims
          hold water to an archeologist or are there better explanations out
          there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host Fredrik and this is episode 20! And it is really nice
          to be somewhat back after a little time off the air. I managed to lose
          my voice for a few days and I am still recovering but it is getting
          better. This will be a bit different episode than we usually have, due
          to vacations and to celebrate our 20 episodes I thought we would dive
          into what somewhat started this whole show. We will look deeper into
          the Bosnian pyramids and I hear you. I know it&rsquo;s not really
          associated with Ancient Aliens but it builds a lot on the same ideas
          as Graham Hancock and his likes. The creator of the bosnian pyramids
          have also in the past claimed that maybe the Mayans were picked up by
          spaceships. So we have some light ancient alien connection here.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also felt it could be interesting to dig into more recent claims
          that might have some archeology tied to it. To be honest we&rsquo;ve
          not seen too much archeology in the latest episodes of Ancient
          Aliens.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if&nbsp; you like the podcast I would really appreciate it if you left
          one of those fancy five star reviews that I&rsquo;ve heard so much
          about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Enough of me jammering let&rsquo;s see what a Bosnian Pyramid is and
          why you would even want one. .

        <p>
          Where to start this story then? I believe it might be best to start
          with the creator of the legends, myth or claim. Whatever you want to
          call it. The claim is rather &ldquo;new&rdquo; in scare quotes, this
          does not stem from some Von D&auml;niken, Sitchin or other 70&rsquo;s
          writers. The claim is from 2005 to be quite precise, dreamt up by a
          Semir Osmanagic or Sam as he sometimes calls himself. Usually we tend
          to focus on the claims and not the person but in this case both of
          them are tied together. If we know Osmanagic we will be able to better
          understand the claims and how they came to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semir was born 1960 in Zenicia, then part of Yugoslavia and today part
          of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He seems to have been part of a family with
          at least one older brother, not much seems to be known about his
          family. Semirs father Muris Osmanagic had a doctorate in Geology and
          worked as a professor. The University is unknown but not that
          important to our story. But Semir in his biography want to stress that
          his father was the receiver of the AVNOJ Award or &ldquo;<em
            >The Award of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of
            Yugoslavia</em
          >&rdquo;. This award was given to people or organizations who had
          contributed to the development of Yugoslavia. Muris Osmanagic received
          this award in 1982 and from the look of things it seems as if they
          lived quite a comfortable life. Semir went on to complete a bachelor
          in political science. Semir also claims to have a MA in international
          economics. But his studies are not yet over but we&rsquo;ll get back
          to them shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semir went on going to work for a for its era and location quite large
          company called United Metal Industry of Sarajevo and after that he
          founded his own import-export company. But a storm was brewing and in
          1992 when the Bosnian War broke out Semir fled and emigrated to the
          United States. Ending up in Huston he came to work for an oil and gas
          company where he became the general manager.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Semir claims to have left the company due to unwillingness from the
          board to update the computer park in the company. Being told no was
          enough for Osmangic and he handed in his resignation. In a later
          interview he describes how he was down on his luck (somehow after
          being a GM for some time) so he loaned money from his friends and
          maxed out his credit cards to start a new business. The banks
          didn&rsquo;t believe in him, they just wanted things like a three year
          financial plan and a lot of paperwork to give him a loan. Those
          bastards, Semir is a man who does things, not planning things. Anyhow
          he did start a business called Met Co. Inc. It seems to still be in
          business so it is not doing too bad, it&rsquo;s been going for some 15
          years plus. If it&rsquo;s something Semir seems to be able to do is to
          run a company properly. If he would have focused more on this I would
          not have had any issues with Semir. But something you will learn about
          Semir Osmanagic is that he loves recognition and wanting to be famous.
          If you read about him he does not really go into his claims, he rather
          tells you about awards, titles and how many applauds he gets after a
          lecture. He enjoys being famous but that&rsquo;s hard in the finance
          industry. Semir knows how to run a company good and proper but they
          are not going on the fortune 500 list anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it is because of this he ventured into
          &ldquo;pseudohistory&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternative science&rdquo;.
          Semir does not go into how he came into these subjects but before he
          created the Bosnian pyramids he had written two books. &ldquo;The
          World of Maya&rdquo; in 2004, in it he talks about how advanced the
          Mayans were and that they might originate from atlantis. In the book
          he talks about the extra-terrestrial influence on the mayan so we have
          an ancient alien connection. The book isn&rsquo;t that great, for
          example he claims there&rsquo;s a pictograph named Ek Chuan or
          &ldquo;star traveler&rdquo;. Supposed to look like a disk with three
          legs. I can&rsquo;t find this one and to be honest I think Semir mixes
          up Ek Chuaj, a quite well known god and the patron of Cacao.
        </p>

          In 2003 he released &ldquo;Alternativna povijest &ndash; tragovima
          Atlantide&rdquo; that contains claims that&rsquo;s not new to us such
          as Hitler escaped to an underworld on Antarctica and fought Rychard
          Byrd in 1946. We did talk about other claims surrounding this back in
          episode 12 with Dr. Bill Farley. There&rsquo;s other new age claims in
          there but nothing new or exciting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did find it a bit amusing that Osmanagic wrote on one of his
          websites for the books that &ldquo;The author has no illusions that he
          "possesses knowledge.&rdquo;. He then adds that he is basically just
          asking questions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s talk about the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; that put Semir
          Osmangaic in the limelight. Located in the Zenica-Doboj Canton in
          Bosnia is a small village named Visoko. It is home to some 40 000
          people and is 30 minutes by car or an hour by train from Sarajevo.
          Here lies the Visočica hill, measuring some 213 meters it towers over
          the nearby village. Looking at the hill from a specific angle and at a
          distance you can see that two sides of it look quite pyramid shaped.
          The two triangular sides also seem to have a square base adding to the
          appearance. It&rsquo;s not hard to see how someone might look at this
          hill and go &ldquo;wow, this somewhat looks like a pyramid&rdquo;. But
          these formations are not that rare in nature and in Colorado you have
          the Flatirons and in Russia near Vladivostok there&rsquo;s two
          formations known as the Russian Twin Pyramids. Interesting tie in here
          is that Phillip Coppens believed that these hills were man made
          pyramids. Coppens, who did appear on a lot of episodes of Ancient
          Aliens, was known to dabble in these types of claims.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in 2005 Osmanagic was in the village to promote his two books. He
          noted the form of the pyramid and upon looking at a compass he
          determined that the sides lined up with the cardinal points in a way
          that nature can&rsquo;t produce. How does he know that? It seems kinda
          as if we need to just accept this as is. A closer explanation
          isn&rsquo;t really given.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is the origin of the Bosnian pyramids. Visočica hill, or
          &ldquo;Pyramid of the Sun&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s known by its believers,
          is just one of several pyramids in the valley. If you go to the other
          side of Visočica you will find what Semir believes is the oldest step
          pyramid called &ldquo;Pyramid of the Moon&rdquo;. Please don&rsquo;t
          mix these up with the pyramids with the same name in Teotihuacan.
        </p>
        <p>
          But while on the other side of Visočica make sure to not look back
          since it would disrupt the illusion of a pyramid. The other hills
          claimed to be pyramids do not really resemble a pyramid either.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Europe isn&rsquo;t really famous for its pyramids. You have for
          example the Falicon pyramid in France, built by different size stones
          and resembles more a cairn than a pyramid. But some speculated that
          this would be part of a shrine from Roman legionaries in an Egyptian
          cult. But more recent excavation seems to indicate it was built
          between 1803 to 1812, most likely by soldiers returning from
          Napoleon's campaign in Egypt. Some older other examples would be the
          pyramid of Hellinikon, one of two in Greece that still stand. Then we
          have the Pyramid of Cestius, built between 18-12 BCE as a tomb for
          Gaius Cestius. The pyramid measures a whopping 125 roman feet tall (or
          roughly 39 meter) and 100 roman feet wide (or as we today would say
          almost 30 meter). The Greek and the Roman pyramids were actually new
          to me and now I have a new reason to go back to Rome. The Roman
          pyramid was created as a grave with a chamber but the Greek ones we
          are not entirely sure what the main purpose was. But all of these were
          built long after the Egyptian pyramids and to be honest Europeeans
          were more into dolmens and tumili than pyramids. The necessary
          infrastructure was not there in Europe until really late and by then
          the fashion was not giant &ldquo;rob me please&rdquo; grave
          markers.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But with this little side step in mind, how old are the pyramids?
          Semir has suggested different dates, first he claims that the Pyramids
          were built by Illyrians who occupied the area (according to Osmanagic)
          between 12000 BCE to 500 BCE. Recently Semir moved the construction
          date back to 35 000 BCE, making it the largest and earliest
          construction of this type. But why this date? Well Semir claims to
          have found a fossilized leaf somewhere in a tunnel beneath the
          pyramid. There&rsquo;s different ways to date a fossil, if it&rsquo;s
          young enough you can do a c14 dating on it and if it&rsquo;s older you
          can use relative dating. The issue here is that we don&rsquo;t know
          where it was found, how it was dated and how it was calibrated. This
          is something we see again and again with Semir Osmanagic claims, the
          claims are not published in any type of journal. No peer-review or
          even a journal mill that publishes anything if you just pay them
          enough. The website isn&rsquo;t of much help either. He spends more
          time on &ldquo;health testimonies&rdquo;, the amount of visitors to
          his lectures and how much applause he gets than on information about
          the pyramids. I&rsquo;ve really tried to dig down into the information
          available in multiple languages but there&rsquo;s not
          much.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the age is a bit unclear but they have excavated the site so there
          should be solid proof of building blocks right? Yes, if you ask Semir
          there is. In fact the pyramids are built of on site poured concrete.
          In fact it&rsquo;s even of better quality than what we can make today.
          But again he does not cite or give any document we can read. Just
          mentions a &ldquo;Institutes for materials from
          Bosnia-Herzegovina&rdquo; and in the Bosnian version of the site (also
          Serbian and Croatian) it&rsquo;s literary only &ldquo;analysis in
          Bosnia Herzegovina&rdquo; (prema analizama bosanskohercegovačkih).
          There&rsquo;s no institute in Bosnia Herzegovina with this name.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;So what do other people have to say about this? An interesting
          thing I found was a quote from Robert Scoch, a frequent flier in
          Ancient Alien circles and not new to strange claims. Scoch is supposed
          to have called the pyramids "It's completely straightforward and
          mundane", I mean if you can&rsquo;t convince Dr. Scoch. The hill
          consists of what all the hills in the area consist of, alternating
          layers of conglomerates (no not companies but a sedimentary type of
          rock), sandstone and clay. Nothing too fancy and the geologists in
          Bosnia are not really surprised with what Semir has found or too
          impressed with his claims.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the dating is unclear, the building blocks are unclear. Does Semir
          offer any more scientific evidence? He did in fact work with Dr. Amer
          Smailbegovic to study the valley with the help of thermal imaging. Dr.
          Smailbegovic claims that with thermal imaging he can detect pyramids
          with the help of imergia. Or what point cools the fastest in the night
          and gets hot fastest in the morning. Smailbegovic does not state how
          this would only affect manmade structures and on closer inspection it
          seems that imergia affects all tall things such as hilltops, mountains
          and even pyramids. So the claim here is not really great again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Semir Osmanagic&nbsp; also claims that there&rsquo;s tunnels beneath
          the pyramids connecting them. But again these claims are just as
          mundane as anything else. There&rsquo;s tunnels but they can be
          natural caves and what&rsquo;s not mentioned is that there was
          extensive mining in the area before. So he could be in mineshafts and
          videos that were circulating before came from a tunnel some 3
          kilometers away from the pyramids. But the precise location is rarely
          given for the tunnels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Osmanagic also took in Henry Oldfield who used a special camera that
          with the help of crystals is replacing colors in the picture. This way
          the camera can see what psychics can see and detect in nature. But how
          this is true seems to be only known to Henry himself and I feel that
          we don&rsquo;t need to delve into this claim until Henry has some more
          concrete evidence that the camera can do what he claims. But Henry
          Oldfields explanations for why this is a pyramid is the same old
          energy collection and that it can harvest energy and electricity.
          Nothing we haven&rsquo;t heard before.
        </p>
        <p>
          What do the archeological community have to say about all of this?
          Already in 2006 the European Society of Archeologists released the
          following statement:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;We, the undersigned professional archaeologists from all
            parts of Europe, wish to protest strongly at the continuing support
            by the Bosnian authorities for the so-called &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo;
            project being conducted on hills at and near Visoko. This scheme is
            a cruel hoax on an unsuspecting public and has no place in the world
            of genuine science. It is a waste of scarce resources that would be
            much better used in protecting the genuine archaeological heritage
            and is diverting attention from the pressing problems that are
            affecting professional archaeologists in Bosnia-Herzegovina on a
            daily basis.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          But reading the Bosnian media would give you another picture. In fact
          there are few reporters and media outlets who critically report on the
          pyramids. To criticize the monuments can lead to harassment and being
          silenced. Zilka Kujundzic-Vejzagic one of Balkans most respected
          archaeologists debated against Osmanagic and would after this be
          described as an &ldquo;enemy of Bosnia&rdquo; by people on the tram
          and receive other threats by phone. The same has been described among
          staff at the University of Sarajevo.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s with this background he started his pHD at the University
          of Sarajevo. Because if there&rsquo;s something you will learn about
          Semir is that he has a pHD and he writes this anywhere. So you think
          he has a doctorate in archeology, anthropology or maybe history? Well,
          do you remember that political science degree we mentioned before?
          Yes, he has a doctorate in political science and that by itself is
          nothing wrong but this thesis looks weird. The title of the
          dissertation is &ldquo;Non-technological Civilization of&nbsp; MAYAS
          versus Modern TECHNOLOGICAL CIVILIZATIONS&rdquo; which I guess could
          fit into political science if you wanted to. But the abstract does not
          give us any information about the aim of the research, method, main
          results or really the conclusion. He spends more time defending how
          the thesis qualifies as a dissertation and that in the end he will
          prove known history wrong. We do not really get any clear research
          questions or objectives. The person Semir points out as a mentor is a
          sociology professor that later turned to teach criminology named
          Hidajet Repovac.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in his dissertation Semir argues that scholars do not classify
          Mayan as a civilization. I&rsquo;m not sure if he is mixing up empire
          with civilization but I&rsquo;ve not really encountered someone
          denying maya to be a civilization. Alright what more then? Moving on
          we learn that Maya culture is older than Olmec and Zapotec and that
          the crystal skulls are evidence of the advanced technology the Mayans
          had.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So as you notice it&rsquo;s hard to understand how the dissertation
          was able to pass. Sure having a committee not familiar with the
          material might have helped but still. They should have denied the
          dissertation much earlier, but we will talk a bit more about the
          university later that might add some more depth here. But to be frank
          this does not show the university of Sarajevo in a good light. Even
          using the crystal skulls, a known hoax, in the thesis should have if
          not failed it at least raised a few red flags.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We could go into more details here but I feel it would be basically to
          be punching down at this point. But again it&rsquo;s important to note
          that Semir is not stupid, again he seems to be a good buissnessman.
          But he seems to enjoy being in the center and being famous.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the past to gain some extra credence written that scientists that
          have nothing to do with the project had leading roles in it. Royce
          Richards is one of them, another is Chris Mundigler and the list can
          be longer. Sometimes the people and connection to Osmanagic&rsquo;s
          project can be real but he inflates their role. Such as Dr. Ali
          Barakat who was described as a pyramid expert &ldquo;sent out by
          Cairo&rdquo; to assist the project. Archeology Magazine did reach out
          to the Supreme Council for Antiquities in Egypt about this Dr. Zahi
          Hawass (then Ministry of State of Antiquities) replied:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The discoverer of the &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; in Bosnia, Semir
            Osmanagić, who claims that a hill near the Bosnia River is a
            man-made structure built before the end of the last Ice Age, is not
            a specialist on pyramids. His previous claim that the Maya are from
            the Pleiades and Atlantis should be enough for any educated reader.
            This &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; is actually a sloping hill near a
            village. /../ Mr. Barakat, the Egyptian geologist working with Mr.
            Osmanagić, knows nothing about Egyptian pyramids. He was not sent by
            the SCA, and we do not support or concur with his statements.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this has not stopped the Pyramid project to become a theme park in
          Visoko. The government has even given the pyramid foundation a lot of
          money to proceed with the project. It sounds strange when the National
          Museum is searching for money to repair damages from the Bosnian war.
          On the subject of the Bosnian war it is maybe not strange that
          &acute;Visoko have opened their arms toward Osmanagic. The town was
          hit hard during the war, most of its industry was destroyed and the
          village never really recovered. But Osmanagic&rsquo;s project and park
          have brought in tourists and money. I think we have some explanations
          for the success here. Due to the war the poverty rate can be up to 20%
          in the countryside and 50% of the population is at risk of becoming
          poor. With Osmanagics claims and parks they can get more tourists and
          with it more money.
        </p>
        <p>
          The monument has also become a symbol for the Bozniacs, nationalists
          who have their seat in Visoko. They see the monument as a proof of the
          greatness of Bosnia and what once was will come again.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is the story of the pyramids of Bosnia. Are the pyramids real?
          No it seems to have been invented by one man and sold to a war torn
          nation desperate for a monument of greatness.&nbsp;
