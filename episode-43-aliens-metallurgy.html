          Weapons, something that has been driving our evolution and survival as
          a species. Ancient Alien theorists suggest alien beings from other
          worlds gave us weapons, metals, and techniques. But what would an
          archaeologist say about all of this?
        </p>
        <p>
          In this episode, we will look at the evolution of metallurgy, from the
          earliest copper age to the invention of steel. What do we know, and
          how did these techniques evolve? As we will see, it was not as simple
          as one might think, as metalwork developed in different regions at
          different times.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also look at Katanas, and they're supposed superior quality.
          Are katana the definitive weapon we see in movies, or is this just
          modern pop culture myths?
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 43, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time we are back in alien territory. This
          episode will cover topics brought up in Ancient Aliens episode 9 from
          season 3 called "Alien and deadly weapons."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Could it be that ancient weapons were gifts from aliens? It will be an
          episode where we focus heavily on metal. I'll guide you through the
          evolution of metalworking, and we will notice that aliens did not have
          anything to do with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I'll bravely declare war against anime experts and katana lovers
          by reviewing common myths about this sword style. Are katanas superior
          to European longswords? Not really, but let's find out.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the last section, I'll talk a bit about Joan D'Arc, and we will
          find out the mundane reality of miracles. So I might upset alternative
          historians, 4chan, and the Catholic church in one episode. That might
          be some sort of record. If you want to support this bravery, stay to
          the end, and I'll tell you how.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Now that we have finished our preparations let's dig into the episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="fire">Fire - an alien gift?</h2>
        <p>
          Where would a logical place be to start an investigation into alien
          weaponry? Apparently, with fire because it's where we will begin
          everything. We have learned over this series that according to the
          Alien Theorist, humans did not invent fire but a gift from the aliens.
          We hear it repeated here, but let's listen to what David Southwell
          says.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In Native American traditions, quite often, it's fire was stolen from
          the world above. In Maori legends, again, we see the theft of fire
          from the gods. In the Greek legends, it's Prometheus stealing fire
          from the gods." - David Southwell.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have been listening to this podcast for a while, you know that,
          as usual, these myths are taken out of context or misrepresent the
          story. Among the Ojibwe, Menominee, Pit River, and other tribes, there
          are elements of fire being stolen by other legendary creatures. But at
          the same time, we find among the Mi'kmaq, Lenne Lenape, and Cherokee
          tribes stories that animals brought the gift of fire to the world. If
          we have to take each account literally, would it not be equally
          probable that an animal taught humans how to make fire? Or could it be
          that these people are trying to make sense of a world with the tools
          and traditions they have?
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Maori legends I could find, there seem to be a couple of
          different versions. The one most repeated, however, is about the
          cultural hero Māui and his interactions with Mahuika. There is a bit
          of trickery within the story; Mahuika stores the power of fire in her
          nails. When the hero meets with this fire goddess, he is well-behaved,
          and she honors his request for fire and hands him a nail. While Māui
          is heading back to the village, he wonders what would happen if
          Mahuika lost her power; how would she create fire? So he put the nail
          out and go back and get another, and another and another.
        </p>
        <p>
          At last, Mahuika loses her temper and tries to kill Māui with fire,
          but the hero receives help from the weather god, who puts the fire
          out. In a last attempt to kill the hero Mahuika throws her final nail,
          but it misses and "implants itself in the Mahoe tree, the Tōtara, the
          Patete, the Pukatea, and the Kaikōmako trees." These trees cherish the
          power of the fire and store it within themself. Māui then carries back
          dry sticks to the village and teaches them how to create fire.
        </p>
        <p>
          The traditional way of making fire is to use "hika ahi" or fire plow.
          The Maori use a sharpened stick from the Kaikōmako tree on a piece of
          Mahoe. This method is far more effective than I thought; from videos
          online, it took a few seconds to work up enough friction to create
          smoke. In a way, I can understand the idea that the Mahuika's power
          was stored in these types of woods. It's a great example of how myths
          are used to explain the world around us. But to add aliens to this
          narrative makes the whole thing illogical. These beings of superhuman
          technology and knowledge visit the Moari just to show them how to
          create fire with two sticks.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have the Prometheus legend, and I believe it's widely
          misunderstood. It's usually said that Prometheus, the titan, and
          friend of Zeus, stole fire and brought it to humans. The issue with
          this narrative is that it's only half of the story. The first known
          preserved telling of the myth comes from Hesiod's "Theogony." Zeus
          demands a sacrificial meal as payment from the mortals. Prometheus,
          who has a soft spot for humans, don't want them to waste the best part
          of the animals. So the titan hides the meat inside the animal's
          stomach and unedible skin in a cube of glistening fat. Zeus, of
          course, goes for the great-looking piece of fat, only to realize the
          rouse when the offering is burnt. As punishment for this, Zeus takes
          away fire from the humans.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that the humans had fire all along, but Hesiod never tells us how
          it was first gotten. But again, Prometheus, who feels for the now cold
          humans, steals the fire back from them and receives his well-known
          punishment from Zeus.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          These are great examples of how these ancient alien experts don't
          understand the myth they quote. Often they base their ideas on a
          public reimagining of these legends. It's almost like using Disney's
          Hercules movie as a source of Greek mythology. Would it not also be
          more logical that the people of time associated fire with heaven due
          to lightning? I wonder.
        </p>
        <h2 id="metalworking">Metal working</h2>
        <p>
          But why are we talking about fire? Well, it sort of leads us to the
          next subject, metalworking. Metals have made our life easier and let
          us as humans do some fantastic things&mdash;also, many bad things,
          some really nasty stuff. How did we create this technology? According
          to Giorgio Tsoukalos, the process went as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We go from attaching sharp stones to the ends of sticks, and then all
          of a sudden, we have actual swords." - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implication is that the shift from the Stone Age to the metal ages
          was so swift that we couldn't have figured this out ourselves. The
          source of metalworking must, therefore, be the alien visitors. Is this
          what we see in the archaeological records? One day our ancestors
          happily created flint tools, and the next day hammered out bronze or
          iron swords.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The answer is, of course, no. As with most technologies, we can find a
          slow but steady evolution of metalworking. The technologies will also
          differ depending on where they are practiced and the raw materials
          avalible to the people&mdash;something we would not expect to see if
          an outside force introduced technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's start at the beginning, shall we? It's not as if we one day
          just picked up a piece of copper and started to hammer it into a
          spear. The first use of metals goes back to the Neolithic age, not to
          create objects but slowly experiment with what we could do with this
          material. Initially, the Neolithic people used red oxide in graves and
          as wall decorations. In the Sumerian towns of Eridu and Susa, they
          used hematite, an iron mineral, to burnish pottery around 4000 BCE.
          Egypt found use for copper minerals in cosmetics due to the green and
          blue colors they produce.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As we see here, people used and experimented with these minerals
          before we got into the Metal Ages. A logical question might be, when
          does a period start? Is it the first time technology is used? The
          first time someone started to hammer on a piece of native copper? Or
          is it when society begins to adopt the technology? I would argue that
          we should set the date when it's adapted, but this is worth
          remembering. The periods are more fluent than we might think at first.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can find early single finds of copper artifacts in the form of
          needles, awls, and beads created around 7000 BCE. These artifacts are
          made from native copper. Native metals are elements that can be found
          in their pure metallic form, meaning you can pick them up and
          recognize them without refining them. Gold is maybe the most obvious
          example of a native metal, I think we all would be able to identify
          this element in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as a copper object has not been heated, we can tell if an
          object is made out of native copper or from mining. But as soon as the
          melting process is introduced, we no longer know if it's native. The
          first objects we find in copper, since before the bronze age, we have
          the forgotten copper age, are cold hammered. They were worked on
          without heating and beaten into shape from their native state.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know quite a bit about native copper and this type of metalworking
          because the indigenous people of America still used this technology as
          the Europeans started their colonization. The issue with cold
          hammering, either copper or gold, is that the end product is
          relatively brittle. So using the metal for tools was out of the
          question, and at first, it appeared to have been a status
          symbol.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But metalwork was a tad limited until the invention of pottery kilns.
          The earliest known use of a kiln can be found in Tepe Ghabristan and
          Tal-i Iblis in Iran, dating to around 6000 BCE. &Ccedil;atal
          H&uuml;y&uuml;k, Turkey, also has a claim to be one of the earlier
          sites; however, the date is quite uncertain and ranges from 7000 BCE
          to 6000 BCE. While the locations on the Iranian Plateau have kilns
          preserved from this era, &Ccedil;atal H&uuml;y&uuml;k has evidence of
          slag. But there was a slow transition from cold hammering technology
          to smelting due to their dependence on native copper. It was not until
          around 3500 BCE that we started to see an increase in objects. With
          the establishment of Sumerian City states, the demand for copper
          increased, encouraging people to go to the highlands in search of
          larger quantities than native copper offers.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We know that the techniques spread rapidly during this time and that
          local copper production was established quickly. Even if the minerals
          were unavailable locally, they were traded for and refined in the
          villages. Several different levels of smelting techniques are becoming
          clear at this point and seem connected to various groups' cultural
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we have spent some time in the near east, it's easy to think
          that copper production originated here and then spread outward. While
          this technology has some diffusionist tendencies, it most likely
          evolved in different places. While Iran and Turkey were relatively
          early in using copper, South East Europe picked up the technology
          around 5000 BCE. The earliest copper usage started around 3000 BCE in
          the Shaanxi province in North West China. The exciting part is that
          they most likely developed independently. Again, not something we
          would see if an outside force introduced this technology.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          After the break, we will enter the Bronze Age and continue our heavy
          metal trip.
        </p>
        <h2 id="bronzeage">Bronze Age</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back! After we started to get the hand of copper and smelting,
          we experimented with alloys and developed, in the end, bronze. The
          introduction of bronze opened new possibilities due to the more robust
          material. More people could afford to invest in bronze since it would
          last much longer than copper tools.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned, bronze was not a sudden creation but a result of
          experimentation. Before bronze, we were already creating alloys. The
          most common was arsenical copper. So by mixing copper and arsenic, you
          could create a metal that was a lot harder compared to copper. The
          main drawback with this method is that you are poisoning everyone
          around you when melting the arsenic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue with tin is that it's scarce in its native form and usually
          found only in granite in a few locations such as China, Bolivia,
          Nigeria, and Cornwall. So if most of the tin is enclosed in granite,
          how did the copper-age people access this material? Aliens? Sure, or
          hear me out, they used a mineral called cassiterite. If found in a
          purer state, this mineral is white, but in most cases, it's found
          diluted with other minerals and then dark in color. But if melted, you
          can extract the tin minerals trapped inside the cassiterite.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of our early bronze seems not to have been created from pure
          ingots; this was something that would come later. So in early bronze
          manufacturing, copper and cassiterite were added together in the
          furnace and were then heated to the melting point of bronze. At this
          point, the cassiterite will then reduce to tin that the copper
          absorbs. The obvious drawback of this method, in turn, is that you do
          not have the same control over the properties between tin and copper.
          You want to have a 12% tin mixture to get the best quality of
          bronze.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When bronze was introduced depends on the culture and area we are
          looking at. We find the earliest bronze work in Mesopotamia. Primarily
          centered around the Euphrates and Tigris Delta, the earliest signs of
          true bronze are at the top of 3000 BCE. In Egypt, we start to see an
          increase of tin in copper production around the fourth dynasty,
          roughly around 2600 BC. Interestingly, Egypt entered its true bronze
          age relatively later than other locations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you remember just a moment ago when we talked about how quickly the
          Iranian plateau developed its melting process? When it comes to
          bronze, these locations were not as quick. Some argue that the people
          in Mesopotamia did keep the tin to go south and leave Iran in a longer
          copper age. But around 2000 BCE, we see how even Iran gain access to
          tin and bronze.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's not forget South America, where we see a concise copper age,
          possibly due to the large tin deposits near Lake Titicaca. Bronze work
          spread along the Pacific coast and the Andes from around 1000 CE. The
          knowledge of bronze seems not to have reached higher than in Peru and
          Ecuador. South American cultures used bronze in axes, knives, pins,
          and chisels. Many of these objects have been found around Machu Pichu
          and other sites. South America has several examples of rather complex
          alloys. In bronze objects in Machu Pichu, we have, for example, tin
          bronze but with an addition of 18% Bismuth. This unusual concoction
          did not make the objects more brittle. But the metal smiths in South
          America seem not to have found the sweet spot of 12% tin. Around Lake
          Titicaca, the chisels and the like contain about 4-9% tin, and around
          Peru and Bolivia, it could range from 0,7% to 13%.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Something we should take note of here is that the shift between the
          technologies here is relatively slow. We often like to imagine that
          people will jump on board a new idea as soon it becomes avalible. Just
          think back on smartphones; while this is a device that most people
          have now, far from everyone got a smartphone in 2007 when they first
          came. I bought my first device in 2011 when they had gotten better and
          more affordable.
        </p>
        <h2 id="ironage">Iron Age</h2>
        <p>
          How is it with the iron ages, then? Philippe Imbrogo put it like
          this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "No one really knows when people first started making steel. Some say
          it only dates 1000 BC."
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe Philippe is talking about iron and not steel. Yet he asks a
          valid question, when did we start to make iron? The question is more
          complex than one might think. Iron, like copper, can be found in a
          native form, especially from meteorites. Therefore, we can see iron
          trinkets, which were created alongside copper. So let's re-phrase the
          question: when did we start working iron with intent and advanced
          techniques, not just cold hammering?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest locations of ironworking can be found at Alaca
          H&uuml;y&uuml;k, where the first known iron dagger was found. But iron
          also had a slow start, and we didn't see large-scale production until
          1200 BCE. From this time forward, iron became the dominant metal to
          some extent. But the Greeks and the Romans used bronze in their armies
          for some time. The Roman military still had armor of bronze up to the
          3rd century CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ironwork has a clearer diffusion spread than copper and bronze. There
          are, however, indications that iron technologies were invented at
          different times and locations. Chinese metalworking began in 600 BCE,
          well after the adaption of Asia Minor. A key difference is that
          Chinese metalwork starts with using blast furnaces. We didn't
          encounter this technology in the Western world until 1100 CE when it
          was created in Sweden. From Sweden this technology then spread
          throughout Europe between 1400 and 1500. Again we see an example of a
          technology independently developing in separate parts of our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Iron smithing was developed so late and slowly because of its
          dependency on heat. To get rid of all impurities, you need to melt the
          iron, and this does not happen until the metal reaches 1540&deg;C. The
          early furnaces were incapable of this, and the furnaces developing
          around 1200 BCE were only capable of heating the iron to 1200&deg;C.
          This is enough to melt the iron and eliminate some impurities or slag.
          The issue is that this reduction, called bloom, will still have
          charcoal and slag left. On top of this, the chemical reduction is
          often in smaller fragments. These pieces must then be welded together
          in the smith's fire and hot hammered.
        </p>
        <p>
          How iron was obtained will also differ depending on where in the world
          you were located. In Sweden and central Europe, access to iron in
          geological rock was minimal during the Iron Age, and they used bog
          iron instead&mdash;a highly impure iron mineral that accumulates in
          bogs, typically fed by iron-rich spring water. These clumps are fished
          out of the wetlands in late spring of midsummer when these areas are
          the dryest. The mineral was then refined and melted in a furnace. When
          I say this mineral is impure, I mean it is impure, from 400 kilos of
          bog iron you get after the reduction about 35 kilos of iron that can
          be used for smithing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the Scandinavian population, the technology was common
          knowledge. We can see this in how much iron is left in the slag at a
          site. Look at the Viking settlement of L&rsquo;Anse aux Meadow in
          Canada. Reading the slag we find at the site, we see that the people
          here knew how to do it but not the expertise. There's a lot of iron
          left in the slag compared to the more skilled ironworkers in Iceland.
        </p>
        <h2 id="blacksmith">Blacksmith magic</h2>
        <p>
          We also get some extraordinary ideas regarding blacksmiths and their
          magical abilities in the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They mustn&rsquo;t look the village blacksmiths in the eyes because
          people are frightened of being killed by his gaze. The blacksmith
          isn&rsquo;t allowed to live in the village because of his magical
          powers." - Peter Fiebag.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we just noted, most people in the middle ages could most likely do
          a bit of everything. Melt ore, maybe hammer out some nails and such
          from that. I've seen some lists of things a person was supposed to be
          able to do in one day. On one, we can learn that a man was supposed to
          be able to do the following:
        </p>
        <p>Dig 80 meters of dike,</p>
        <p>cut down 15 trees,</p>
        <p>cut six loads of firewood,</p>
        <p>cut 100 hop sticks,</p>
        <p>sharpen and polish 110 pairs of poles for roundpole fence,</p>
        <p>build a sled,</p>
        <p>add two layers of logs on a log house,</p>
        <p>cut 100 sheaves of leaves.</p>
        <p>
          This is just an example of what someone in Sweden would be expected to
          perform during the day. But you need tools and be able to maintain
          them. In contrast to what Peter Fiebag told us, the blacksmith was
          very important in society and even had a guild. It is correct that
          myth and superstition surrounded the smith occupation. Some myths
          might even be due to how the smith operates. You see, some parts of
          the blacksmith's work could be done in public. The smith won't care if
          you see him hammer iron or steel since this is a skill you must
          acquire over several years. The melting process, though, was something
          they wanted to keep for themself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The myths I've found regarding the smiths seem pretty tame. Anvil dust
          is supposed to have magical properties. But in the minds of the past,
          many things were supposed to have magical properties. The blacksmith
          position in society was a lot better than we're led to believe by the
          Ancient Alien proponents.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we saw with the Viking settlement in Canada, they were terrible at
          melting iron compared to the craftsman in Iceland. They most likely
          wanted to keep the melting process to themselves and within the
          guilds. Learning how to get the proper temperature to get good steel
          will not take years of training. As with any secrecy, this led to
          speculation and superstition. However, it was never on the level we
          heard here; this sounds more as they describe an executioner than a
          smith.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As you see here, the Alien Astronaut theorist have simplified a pretty
          complex process to the extent it's misguiding. What I've gone over
          here is just a scratch on the surface, and we could go deeper into
          different periods and technologies. A subject we will revisit and
          maybe a subject we should dedicate an episode to in the future. But
          let's move on and investigate some of the alien's deadliest weapons,
          just after these messages.
        </p>
        <h2 id="katana">Japanese weapons</h2>
        <p>
          As we head into the next section, I have to admit something. I would
          love to be a sword nerd, and I've tried hard to be one, but alas. The
          sword fewer has eluded me; while I find swords pretty and maybe a bit
          fun to wave around, I'm not an expert. Luckily others are, and I did
          consult a couple of them since this next part might upset some of the
          neckbeards and dweebs online.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ancient Aliens' theorists are heading into Samurai territory and
          the mystical katana. Most of it is not too bad, Rafael Kosche, who
          seems to be the History Channel resident sword expert, does a decent
          job explaining the history of the katana. Some Japanese fetishism is
          sneaking in here and there, but Rafael does not say something
          extraordinarily odd. Keeping in mind he is a white American talking
          about Japanese swords. He covers some rituals and myths about the
          katana, but it's not until Michael Dennin from UC Irvine jumps in
          things go wrong.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;The famous stories are always, of course, the Japanese steel
          used for the samurai blade. It&rsquo;s been very hard to reproduce
          because some of these processes can be incredibly sensitive to the
          exact detail of the temperature. Some of its features are just its
          flexibility and the way they fold it over and over, and its incredible
          strength and its resistance to oxidation, which is what you really
          need to keep something sharp.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Japanese iron quality was not as excellent as most legends make it out
          to be. A Tatara could not get the iron hot enough to melt it, leaving
          slag, coal, and other impurities behind. What comes out of the
          Japanese furnace is referred to as tamahagane. We can call it iron ore
          for simplicity. This ore will then have varying quality and impurity,
          and the best parts are more silvery-looking in color. The finest bits
          are then selected and turned into steel swords.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The sword smiths then repeatedly folded and hammered the iron was
          developed as a way to get these impurities out of the iron. The
          technique was necessary to create a good quality product. But the
          reason why European, Asian, African, or any other regions working iron
          or steel did this was due to their better furnaces. Using the folding
          technique on mono steel without impurities will not improve the
          product. The impressive feat we see here is that Japan figured out how
          to turn something lackluster into a good quality product. Ultimately,
          it all comes down to how you tamper the steel. If the tampering is
          terrible, it does not matter how excellent the steel quality is. You
          will have a lousy product.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So as things turn out, there is no secret behind the steel of Katana
          Swords. But how about the idea that Katanas is much sharper and better
          than any other sword? We saw that the steel is not different from what
          we find elsewhere, just using a different method. The legendary
          sharpness, however, is a modern myth. It originates from B-movies back
          in the day in combination with the idea that European swords were dull
          clubs.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The dull medieval swords are a myth with a bit of unclear origin. It
          could originate from the fact that some European sword techniques
          include the fighter holding the sword by its blade. So the logic is
          that if you hold a sword by the edge, you want it dull so you don't
          cut yourself. But reading the manuals of the time, we learn there are
          ways to control the blade without slicing yourself, and as long you
          don't slide the hand up or down, you don't have something to worry
          about. The knight also had leather gloves making it even safer. Test
          it yourself, take a knife, and press your thumb against the edge. You
          won't cut yourself, and it won't even leave a mark. [Static noice] So
          my lawyer just told me that you should not try this at home. I'm also
          supposed to add that this show is only for educational and
          entertainment purposes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jokes aside, the katana is a sword with a long tradition. There will
          be katanas of excellent quality and those of bad quality. Rituals and
          mythology do not make the blades exemplary; experienced smiths are. It
          does not matter if they operated in Japan, China, Scandinavia, or
          wherever. There have been people with great skill, talent, and the
          connection to get their hands on the best raw materials. There is no
          room for alien intervention in all of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's leave Japan and turn our gaze toward France. Have some
          historical figures had access to weapons of alien power?
        </p>
        <h2 id="joandarc">Joan D'Arc&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          How about historical people? Do we have any examples of these having
          access to these magical alien swords? According to the Ancient Alien
          Theorists, it so happened that Joan D'Arc had one of these magic
          weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When Joan of Arc was arrested and brought to what we now know of as
          her condemnation trial, her inquisitors were determined to get
          information about her sword. Her inquisitors were obsessed about
          finding out about her sword, and that is because Joan of Arc's sword
          was reputed to have legendary power, divine power. Joan claimed that
          her voices, her angelic voices, led her to this sword."
        </p>
        <p>
          Joan D'Arc is a character we will devote more time to in a future
          episode. We're not given much here, and they get into some problematic
          stuff in a different episode. The short story of Joan's life is that
          she was most likely in 1412 and is most known for her part in the
          100-year war. Joan claimed that angels and saints were giving her
          divine knowledge and was part of leading the French to victory and
          installing Charles VIII on the throne.
        </p>
        <p>
          How is it then, were the inquisitors of Joan D'Arc interested in the
          sword? Luckily for us, the records of Joan's trials have been
          preserved. I'm using Daniel Hobbins's translation, but a few online
          resources that are freely avalible. I will have linked those as well
          on the episode page.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          No preserved record mentions the sword possessing any magical power.
          In Joan's trial, they spend some time talking about her swords. We
          learn, "She says as soon as the sword was found, the clergy there
          rubbed it and at once the rust fell off effortlessly." Something that
          might be expected when an angel foretells a sword, but they then
          detail the colors of the different scabbards she got by the village
          where the sword was found.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          They then asked if she had put any blessings on the sword or curses,
          which Joan denied, indicating that the sword was important to her
          because it was found in the Cathrine du Fierbois Cathedral. Joan's
          favorite saint and the reason for the importance of the sword. While
          being asked if she had tried to pray to make the blade give her better
          luck, she is supposed to have said, "It&rsquo;s good to know that I
          would have wished my armor&rdquo;&mdash;mon harnois in
          French&mdash;&ldquo;to have good fortune."
        </p>
        <p>
          Joan was wounded twice in battle; the scribe seem to have left some of
          her wit in the protocol. They spend almost more time on the banner
          this day, and Joan even says she prefers having the banner into battle
          over the sword. She intended not to hurt anyone, so the flag was more
          suitable for her.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Some exciting piece of information regarding the story about Joans
          sword can be found in Chronique de la Pucelle and Journal du
          si&egrave;ge d'Orl&eacute;ans. In these chronicles, the story of this
          sword is brought up, but they differ a little from what we hear at the
          trial. According to these earlier accounts, Joan asks for a sword from
          Saint Catherines du Fierbois Cathedral. The important part is that
          it's supposed to have five crosses on the blade.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Chronique de la Pucelle there was a box of swords
          "However, there were several that had once been given to the church" /
          "Toutesfois, il y en avoit plusieurs qu'on avoit autresfois
          donn&eacute;es &agrave; l'&eacute;glise." So apparently, there was a
          custom among the knights who survived the Battle of Agincourt to leave
          their swords at this church as a token of gratitude for Saint
          Catherine having protected them in the battle. As for the rust, we are
          told in Journal du si&egrave;ge d'Orl&eacute;ans that the sword was a
          bit rusty, but when Joan had confirmed they took the right one, it was
          cleaned and polished.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;During these things, she said that she wanted to have a sword
          that was at Saint Catherine du Fierbois, where there were five crosses
          in the blade, fairly close to the handle. They asked her if she had
          ever seen her, and she said she had not; but she knew very well that
          she was there. She sent there, and there was no one who knew where she
          was or what it was. However, there were several that had formerly been
          given to the church, which they all had to look at, and one was found
          quite rusty, which had the said five crosses. It was brought to her,
          and she said it was the one she asked for. If was polished and well
          cleaned&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Note here that the chroniclers don't give this sword any magical
          attributes. Neither do we see this in the trial; the inquisitor wants
          Joan to have used magic with the blade. If it were magic, they would
          have had more charges toward Joan, but the questions don't get them
          the answers they want. If the inquisitors had had the evidence for the
          sword's magical properties, they would have brought this up. I assume
          it would be the same with the chroniclers. If it was magic, why not
          boost this and the favor of the all-mighty lord?&nbsp;
        </p>

          I will close out the show on this note&mdash;the evidence for ancient
          aliens where not found this time either. Let's try again next
          time.&nbsp;
