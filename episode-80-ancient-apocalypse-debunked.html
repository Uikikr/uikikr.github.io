        <p>
          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens! This is the podcast where we
          examine alternative history and Ancient Alien narratives in popular
          media. Do these ideas hold water when examined by an archeologist, or
          are there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 80, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we are back again to tackle Ancient
          Apocalypse with Graham Hancock. Has he mellowed out recently, or will
          things go off the rails sooner rather than later? I won’t linger too
          long here, because we are in for a few new sites to visit, such as
          White Sands and the Amazon rainforest.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let’s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2>A species with amnesia</h2>
        <p>
          We are a species with amnesia, or at least that’s what we are
          according to Graham Hancock. I really wish this was accurate and that
          I could wipe away my memory after yet again watching Ancient
          Apocalypse. Watching this series and looking at the claims is like
          being Frodo, carrying the One Ring, with all of you as my Samwise - a
          burden I'm taking on so others won’t have to. Unlike Frodo, though,
          there's no glorious ending or peace to the Shire (in the books, the
          Shire was destroyed– just saying!). There is just the slight relief
          that the show is over, for now. The keys click clack whilst I look for
          answers, me thinking that not even Kerouac levels of whiskey will
          bring me to the amnesia Hancock mentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what are we dealing with in season two of Ancient Apocalypse? Was
          not everything said in season one? Well, according to us elitist
          archaeologists, I would say it was, but apparently, those in charge of
          Netflix programming thought otherwise. Netflix cancels great shows
          like they have a personal vendetta against joy and character
          development. Still, for some reason, Netflix keeps this garbage on.
          Even the GOOP lab only ran for one season.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Ancient Apocalypse season two, we now have an overall theme—the
          Americas. A reason I see behind it is that it allows Hancock to reuse
          ideas from the previous season to spin a tale with a specific
          narrative. But as Penelope, we now need to unravel this weave and look
          at the facts Hancock presents and how it fits into the historical
          tapestry. So, let's dive into the tangled narratives and step into one
          of nature's most striking creations. Enter White Sands—a place where
          the story isn't written with an agenda but with gypsum.
        </p>
        <h2 id="whitesands">White Sands</h2>
        <p>
          We now look out over a vast, captivating New Mexico desert landscape.
          The name really says it all. We see dunes that stretch for some 750
          square kilometers and are gleamingly white. The color comes from the
          composition of the sand, gypsum. To make a quick overview of the
          area's formation, during the Permian era, starting around 298.9
          million years ago, this area was underwater, but when it retreated, it
          left behind a calcium sulfate-rich area. Tectonic activities would
          later form the mountains Sacramento and San Andres. Fast forward, and
          rain and water pulled the gypsum out of these peaks, pouring out in
          what today is known as the Tularosa Basin. Once a large lake, this
          later dried out, leaving crystallized gypsum or Selenite left behind.
          Some water would travel further to the Hueco Basin, leaving leftover
          gypsum that would form into Akali Flat. However, the sand we see in
          the dunes comes from Lake Lucero and dries up each year. Wind erodes
          the Akali Flat crystals found here, creating the fine sand in the
          dunes.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, from a geological perspective, the site is well understood, and
          the American National Park Service has a lot of material available to
          the public. This is not the reason why we are here. No, the real
          reason is that Hancock thinks this is an excellent example of where
          archaeology is wrong. He will use archaeology and geology to
          demonstrate this. Hancock claims that a secret has been found here
          that will overturn the accepted history of the Americas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that Hancock leaves out of the series is that the accepted
          history has already changed. To be frank, Graham is a bit late on the
          ball here. What's hinted at is that mainstream archaeology thought
          that there was no earlier entry into the Americas than around 13 500
          BCE. We have a slight hint at Clovis's first theory from the first
          season and his books. Things have changed during the last 30 years as
          more and more evidence exists for people settling earlier in the
          Americas. The earliest settlement found so far in North America is the
          Bluefish Caves in the Yukon territories. At this location, thousands
          of animal bones were found with butcher marks. The oldest bone so far
          dates back 24,000 years BP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study was published in 2017, and the authors Lauriane Bourgeon,
          Ariane Burke, and Thomas Higham suggest a small standstill population
          lived in the area during the last Glacial Maximus. They estimate that
          the female population would have been around 1000 to 2000 people and
          probably never extended to more than 10,000 people. As the glacier
          melted around 13,000 BCE, those living at the Bluefish Cave started to
          move down. While it's among the oldest confirmed dates, many more
          sites exist dating from 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. A site that is
          controversial in a sense is Toca da Tira Peia, a rock shelter in
          Brazil. Stone tools have been found at the site. Unfortunately, there
          have not been any hearths or other objects that can be C14 dated. A
          team led by Christelle Lahaye performed thermal luminescence dating on
          stones found in the third layer at the site, indicating a date around
          22,000 BP. As we have discussed previously in this show, thermal
          luminescence dating is a valuable tool, but sometimes dates can be
          unreliable. Without other dating methods, such as C-14, there will
          remain question marks regarding the date. But as always, more data
          will hopefully show whether this initial date is correct. This
          particular study was published in 2013. Even in the south of South
          America, we have dates at the site called Monta Verde, which has
          secure dates to around 14,800 BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why Graham Hancock is at White Sands is due to a rather fantastic
          find. Footprints of humans and megafauna are preserved in the gypsum.
          For thousands of years, this area has witnessed the footsteps of
          people walking, running, and hunting, leaving behind a rich tapestry
          of human history. The paths they trod are etched into the landscape,
          telling stories of survival, exploration, and connection to the land.
          A story that might go as far back as 23,000 years before our time.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022, Mathew Bennet et al. published an article in Nature arguing
          that some footsteps preserved in the gypsum could be dated back to
          23,000 BP. This data is based on the surrounding animal tracks and
          radiocarbon dating of macroscopic seeds from the aquatic Ruppia
          Cirrhosa. These seeds were found in situ within the tracks, suggesting
          they had been there since their creation. Here in this episode, I
          started to sense a shift in Hancock's demeanor; he seems to be
          softening compared to the aggressive persona we encountered in the
          show's inaugural series. He tries to sow the idea that there is this
          significant attempt to dismiss the find. We get a quote: "The carbon
          dating of the seeds was challenged. But the team confirmed their
          results, using other samples of pollen and sediment quieting their
          critics."
        </p>
        <p>
          What Hancock describes here is The Scientific Process (™). You publish
          something, and others will look at it and ask questions. In this case,
          the team behind the original study returned and completed more tests,
          which could provide even better support for their initial claim.
          Criticism isn't always bad; sometimes, people find flaws, but if your
          theory is sound, you can use this to build an even better case for the
          theory. Hancock, however, isn't used to the scientific process;
          instead of looking at the criticism, he takes it as a personal insult.
          Instead of addressing the flaws of his arguments, the archaeology
          mafia is just out to get him. It sounds odd, but to some extent,
          science is about disproving a theory. We don't aim to do that out of
          maleficence but to test if the theory and methods are sound. If you
          only seek to prove an idea, then it's easy to miss things or get a
          sort of tunnel vision. By trying to disprove your theory, you will end
          up with a stronger argument for your case. That's why a hypothesis a
          scientist asks needs to be stated in a way that can be either
          confirmed or dismissed.
        </p>
        <p>
          White sands may be an important site since it shows that some managed
          to get past the Glacial Maxiumus up north and walk down south. A
          question I have, that later got an answer, is why Hancock chose White
          Sands of all places. As I mentioned, we have an earlier date up in
          Bluefish Cave. A boon for Hancock would also have been that Jacques
          Cinq-Mars was one of those working at the site. Cink-Mars is one who,
          early on, questioned the Clovis-First Theory and got, to put it
          mildly, a lot of flack for it. The objections to his work were
          sometimes both harsh and unfair. Only proven right about his theory
          that the cave predates Clovis after his death. I mean, from Hancock's
          perspective, this should be a gold mine. He could go to town on the
          toxic Clovis First proponents that set an unreasonable high bar of the
          burden of proof. But why didn't Graham bite?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the site can't be connected to his Younger Dryas Impact Theory.
          Evidence also suggests that some species the community here relied on
          were hunted to extinction, a point that will become more important in
          a moment. Why White Sands is the example is that it's older than the
          previous version of the Behringer Straight theory; as I mentioned,
          it's now fairly accepted that people came to the Americas pre-13,000
          BCE. It also contains extinct megafauna. We are presented with the
          fact that those large animals hunted by the land's early inhabitants,
          according to Hancock, went extinct within a very narrow timeframe.
          Such a brief period that it could only be attributed to a meteoric
          impact, drastically changing the environment and wiping the animals
          out.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you might know, Hancock is one of those who suggests that a comet
          hit Earth some 12,000 years ago. This impact caused, according to the
          Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis, the Younger Dryas cooling of the
          Northern Hemisphere. This caused an enormous catastrophe and destroyed
          an extensive advanced civilization. Some remnants of this lost bygone
          society then traveled the world, spreading warnings and knowledge
          wherever they went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock seems to argue that White Sands, in this case, is evidence of
          this meteoric impact. The issue here is that while there is no
          credible evidence of this event taking place or the civilization
          existing, the extinction of animals took place over a long time. Some
          species died out before this hypothetical impact took place. Others
          lingered around until well after the impact had taken place. It is
          worth noting that the extinction of megafaunas does not look the same
          across the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here in Europe, we have an extensive timeline for the cessation of
          megafaunas living there. If we look closely at how the megafauna
          started to go extinct, we see that it was not simultaneously. No, we
          see that each species has a unique pattern; some survive while others
          don't, as Stuart put it in a 2015 paper. The reason for the extinction
          is hard to map and most likely will differ from region to region.
          There are a few different suggestions, like the overkill hypothesis,
          that humans hunted the animals to extinction. Or the environmental
          change hypothesis, that ecological changes took place, changing the
          animal's environment to an extent they could no longer survive. Both
          of these have pros and cons, and none can really explain to a
          satisfactory level the extinction event that took place alone. A
          hybrid hypothesis could be a more adequate explanation, that
          environmental changes put a strain on the animal population and humans
          basically killed the smaller groups off. This could explain why
          pockets of these animals lived through the Paleolithic up to the
          Mesolithic.

          Then we have a few more far-out ideas, such as the Y.D.I.H., but it's
          been, at this point, fairly disproven. I recommend reading Vance
          Holliday et al.'s paper "Comprehensive refutation of the Younger Dryas
          Impact Hypothesis" for a more detailed explanation. I'm also quite
          sure that we will return for a deep dive into this argument at a later
          point. We also have the hyperdisease hypothesis, the main issue being
          that no known disease would only affect large animals. Another problem
          is how it would spread globally at this point in history only among
          animals. We also have the Solar flare hypothesis, similar to the YDIH,
          in that a catastrophic event took place, causing a mass extinction. It
          suffers from the same problem as the YDIH; the extinction was
          staggered. It was not an event taking place at one point in time.
          Another issue is why megafauna, like giant ground sloths, are
          affected, and not bears or humans?
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can see, the extinction of large animals roaming the earth is
          more nuanced than Hancock's explanation. In the program, Hancock also
          only brings up the overkill hypothesis as the only alternative cause
          for what happened. In an attempt to disarm that argument, Hancock
          simply notes that "humans won't hunt animals to extinction." While
          there are much better arguments against that over hunting animals are
          the only reason for the extinction, this comment is just plain wrong.
          A tempting example would be the classical Dodo. Still, the demise of
          this flightless bird previously found in Mauritius is a bit more
          complicated. While human hunting of the birds most likely didn't help.
          The actual death was at the tusks of feral pigs introduced by humans
          in the 1600s, as argued by Cheke and Parish in a 2020 paper. The feral
          pigs are known to eat eggs from turtles and would most likely have
          feasted on the ground-bound birds' offspring too. Combine these three
          elements: agriculture taking away habitats, humans hunting the birds,
          and a new invasive species eating the eggs. Altogether, it would have
          been a miracle that the Dodo had survived. Note also how humans are
          the underlying cause for all these three threats to the dodo.
        </p>
        <p>
          A better example may be found in the case of the Zubr or, in English,
          the European bison. The bison was extinct in Britain in 1100 CE, and
          in France, it was gone by 1300 CE. The animal population survived
          until later in other parts of Europe, but around 1800, these
          populations disappeared in Germany and Transylvania. The only enclave
          left could be found in the Białowieża Forest on the border of Poland
          and Belarus. The reasons for the extinction were growing farmland and
          hunting. By 1857, some 1900 bison were roaming the Białowieża, a
          number that would quickly shrink with the start of the First World
          War. While there seems to be a bit of a discussion if the last Zubr
          was shot in 1919 or 1921 in Poland, we know the hunter was a man
          called Bartłomiej Szpakowicz. Again, while hunting was a huge factor,
          other human activities, such as farming, contributed to the
          extinction. Another example would be the Steller's Sea Cow or
          Hydrodamalis gigas. It was discovered in 1741 and gone by 1768, which
          is less than 30 years after the discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          White Sands is a fantastic place and an important archaeological site.
          It gives us a better understanding of the past. The issue here is that
          it does not support Hancock's idea. As we can see, it does not support
          the idea of a global cataclysm. The only reason to bring this site up
          is for Hancock to argue against outdated ideas. The dates for the
          first people in America have been moved back, and this site is only
          one piece that fits in a larger puzzle. I hate to say this, but this
          would have been a brilliant segment if Hancock had only focused on the
          site and left out his YDIH nonsense. This is why if I had to read
          Hancock or any other pseudohistory author, I prefer Hancock. However,
          this little positive comment does not take anything away from all the
          misinformation we got in the part. For now, we will leave the White
          Sands and go further south into the Amazon.

        <h2 id="Amazon">Amazon and Civilizations</h2>
        <p>
          Graham Hancock takes us from the US down to Acre, a province in modern
          Brazil that shares a border with both Peru and Bolivia. We're told
          that archaeologists have long refuted the idea of a complex society
          living in the Amazon. To a point, this is correct; as Charles Mann, in
          a 2008 article in Science, points out, it was thought to be barren of
          civilization. I would prefer to use the term complex society instead
          of civilization; both terms are not great, but the former might be a
          bit less loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          People have lived in the Amazon for millennia, but what has not been
          found is a culture similar to the Inka or other South American
          cultures built in stone, etc. We are here, though, because there seems
          to have been a culture creating mounds and geoglyphs that have
          recently been discovered due to the logging in the region. Some of
          these structures were found in 1977 by Alccu Ranzi, a paleontologist
          today, as part of a survey. The discovery was not announced until
          almost a decade later by the National Program for Archaeological
          Research, sponsored by the Smithsonian. The announcement gained little
          attention, and not much happened until the early 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, thanks to a team including Dr. Martti Pärssinen from Helsinki
          University, Alccu Ranzi, and Dr. Denise Schaan, we know more about
          these earthworks. Some 450 of these sites have been identified so far
          in the state of Acre. They can be linked by a similar ceramic culture
          that seems to be influenced, according to Pärssinen, by Western
          Amazonian Formative styles. The earthworks come in several different
          shapes, and according to Kalliola et al., the most common are
          trapezoid, rectangle, square, oval, and circular. Then there are the
          geoglyphs that are ditches inside embankments, and there are about 500
          of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest of these dates back to around 500 BCE or year 0. Some of
          those constructed later during the first millennium seem to have been
          used until the 1300s CE. One ceramic chard in one of the earthworks
          has been dated to 1211–942 CAL B.C.E. Still, the authors, Denise Shaan
          et al., are not sure if it's really connected to the construction.
          Other pottery found in the enclosure dates to around 2000 BP. The
          earlier pottery found within the earthworks is not strange. We know
          that sites are reused over time. As Pärssinen points out in a 2021
          paper, there is a context issue with these earlier dates. They are not
          found within the embankment walls where most of the pottery is. They
          are often found at other locations that do not seem to be connected
          with the constructions of these rampart-like monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, the sites are interesting and deserve more attention. But why
          is Graham Hancock here? Well, it's a good question, to be honest. The
          section is framed around that the site was first ignored, a somewhat
          accurate statement. Remember, Hancock loves to use old ideas to show
          that archaeology does not approve of new discoveries. Something that's
          frankly untrue about both of these locations. While the actual work on
          these geoglyphs and earthworks didn't start until early 2000, it's out
          there now. With the benefits of archaeologists being able to look at
          these structures with the tools and knowledge we have today for the
          first time. We can discover even more of these with LiDAR and other
          digital equipment. Then, we can apply modern standards to the
          excavations to get data people in 1977 could only dream of. The longer
          a site is left untouched, the more data we can pull out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part is that Hancock sees a connection to Greece at the
          site, and recently, there might be evidence that the site has been
          used since 10,000 BP. This ancient date comes from a paper by Dr.
          Pärssinen that also appears in the episode. This was published in 2020
          and suggests that there might be evidence of slash-and-burn
          agriculture in Acre. Pärssinen points out that this potential
          agricultural practice is not associated with the mounds themselves.
          They are separated by 1000s of years, but the site has been reused and
          occupied for a long time. The difficulty here is to prove it was a
          controlled swaddling of the area and not your run-of-the-mill forest
          fire. That can be tricky, but it could be done by showing it's in a
          confined area. Even then, it could be argued it was a local wildfire.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are attempts at developing techniques that can show if
          the fire is for swaddling or natural. Dussol et al. published a paper
          trying to establish a slash-and-burn baseline in 2021. In 2022,
          Heidgren et al. published a paper showing that agrarian fires were
          used in Germany around 9500 BP. This paper relied on pollen and
          charcoal analysis, among other things, and could show small but
          frequent fires, indicating that the population used fire to prepare
          their fields. While Pärssinen's paper that could show agricultural
          practices in the area dating back to 10,000 BP is very interesting, I
          have to agree with what Pärssinen wrote in the conclusion. "We are
          aware that the evidence presented here is not yet conclusive and that
          we require more archaeological data and additional radiocarbon and
          carbon isotope δ13C measurements from Western Amazonia."
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned, Hancock is trying to connect the sites in Acre with
          Greece. Now, he does not claim that the people of the West Amazon had
          contact with the Greeks. No, Graham is not that silly. He claims that
          they got their patterns and ideas of geometry from the same source:
          the traveling sages. Hancock tries to make the claim that historians
          think that the Greeks were among the first to create geometry. This is
          a strange claim since geometry was used in Babylon, the Indus Valley,
          and Ancient Egypt thousands of years before the Greeks. It's also an
          attempt to connect the pottery and the sites to the Geometric period
          in Greece. An issue here is that the Geometric period starts around
          1025 BCE and is heavily influenced by Mycenaean pottery. Hancock
          attempts to draw a connection between the ceramics from the Acre
          region and Greek pottery by positioning them side by side. Yet, an
          examination reveals that they bear little resemblance to one another.
          Even when scrutinized closely, their differences stand out starkly.
          While both pottery styles showcase captivating geometric patterns, the
          influences that inspire them are strikingly divergent, reflecting the
          unique cultural narratives and artistic traditions from which they
          originate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock also mentions polychromatic pottery, or pottery decorated with
          more than two colors, as evidence for these wandering sages. From the
          episode, it almost seems as if this style suddenly appeared in the
          area around when the earthworks and geoglyphs were constructed. In
          reality, polychromatic pottery begins in Guyana, Venezuela, and Upper
          Madeira around 1500 BCE. This early formative period lasted until
          around 300 BCE. It was not until around 50 B.C.E. that we got certain
          proof of polychromatic pottery in the Acre region, with the
          possibility of an earlier date of 350 BCE. However, this is based on
          the vessel shape rather than the presence of color. Note here that the
          technology didn't suddenly appear out of nowhere. It developed and
          spread over 1000 years. Or maybe Hancock postulates that the wise
          sages liked the people in Guyana enough to teach them that you can use
          more than two colors on pottery but not enough to build earth walls in
          geometric shapes?
        </p>
        <p>
          The site is an incredible discovery, and it will be interesting to see
          what comes next. As for evidence of a supposed lost civilization
          traveling the globe? It's really a miss. Don't get me wrong, the
          earthworks are impressive, but they are, in a sense, easy to
          construct. The layout can be quite simply created with ropes and
          sticks. Like how the Nazca lines were created, experimental
          archaeology shows that two people with string, sticks, and time could
          easily recreate the geoglyphs on the plateau. A circular earthwork can
          be made with a stick, string, and a walk around in a circle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock's theory brings forth a compelling inquiry regarding the
          original civilization, which he himself concedes lacks substantial
          supporting evidence—a point he acknowledged during his discussion on
          Joe Rogan's podcast. It is intriguing to ponder why this ancient
          civilization would distribute technology in such an erratic manner.
          For instance, some groups received the remarkable expertise to
          construct monumental structures like imposing pyramids, the elegant
          Parthenon, intricate metalwork, and astonishing megalithic structures.
          In stark contrast, others were provided with more basic tools, such as
          vibrantly colored ceramics and rudimentary instructions for building
          earthen walls. While the simplicity of these creations does not
          undermine the remarkable achievements of the peoples inhabiting Acre,
          it does cast a shadow of curiosity over Hancock's narrative, raising
          critical questions that he neither explores nor addresses.
