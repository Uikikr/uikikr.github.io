          Vikings - many myths surround this era and the people of Scandinavia
          who lived during this time. Were they raiders, traders, or a bit
          in-between? Let's look into what a Viking was and what the word meant,
          and who could call themselves a Viking. As we will learn, it is less
          clear-cut than one might believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also talk about the Viking horned helmets. Are these accurate
          depictions? The answer might be surprising and have a strange
          connection to the Scandinavian Bronze Age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did the Vikings have tattoos, as in the famous TV show? What do we
          know about their body art? Is the Vegvisir a Viking symbol? And why
          should you make an appointment with your dentist instead of a tattoo
          artist to have the Viking look?
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll also investigate why the sheep was one of the most important
          animals in Scandinavia and might have been the reason for the Viking
          raids and slavery. At last, we will learn that the Vikings might have
          based their society on their looks.
        </p>

          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is episode 42, and I'm your host, Fredrik. It's still vacation
          time here in Sweden when this is recorded, and I don't have access to
          my usual library. So I decided to do an episode about a topic that is
          my specialty, the Vendel and Viking period in Scandinavia. If Andrew
          Kinkella could talk about his work on Mayan cenotes in his show
          "Psuedo-archaeology with Kinkella," I can spend an hour talking about
          Vikings and common myths, darn it. So that is what we will do.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll talk about the beginning of the Vendel/Viking age; then, we will
          discuss who would be a Viking. I'll then talk about the horned
          helmets, and that they are a real thing, we just put them in the wrong
          period. Then I'll upset some by talking about Viking tattoos and
          magic. We will also learn why the Vikings needed a lot of sheep.
          Lastly, I'll show that the Scandinavian society during this era was a
          constant beauty competition among men.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations let's dig into the episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="vikingage">When was the Viking Age?</h2>
        <p>
          So where do we start a story like this? As with any other tale, we
          might be interested in knowing when our account takes place. So when
          we speak about the Viking Age, we discuss a relatively short chapter
          in Scandinavian history. For the purpose of our saga, we will also
          include the Vendel period. An even shorter branch on our tree of time
          and is, I believe, relatively unknown outside of Sweden.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to chronology, it's understandably easy to forget that
          there is no global Stone Age, Bronze Age, or Metal Age in general. For
          example, some of you might think the Iron Age would be the same across
          Europe and the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, that's far from the case
          here; for example, in the Near East, by convention, the Iron Age
          lasted from the Bronze Age collapse around 1200 BCE to about 500 BCE.
          Compare this to Central and Western Europe, where the Iron Age is
          defined to be between 800 BCE to 1 BCE. Add to this mess Northern
          Europe where the Iron Age last from 500 BCE to 800 CE. To throw some
          more chronology your way here in Sweden, we have split the Iron Age
          into sub-chronologies, starting at Pre-Roman Iron Age, Roman Iron Age,
          and Migration Period, and continuing through the Vendel period that is
          set to begin at 550 CE. So while Sweden is enjoying an excellent
          Vendel period, the rest of Europe has entered the middle ages already.
          But when does the Viking age start, then?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was June, but Cenric still used his cloak; the air was nippy, and
          one could easily believe it was March. His belly grumbled; while the
          monastery had been spared from the worst of the famine, they were not
          immune. Lunch had not been too long ago, but he was already longing
          for supper, he thought while scurrying past the refectory for his work
          at the herb garden. None had just been sung, and it was time for work.
          The abbot had been looking worried, and who could blame him? Cenric
          had seen the sign himself, the sudden whirlwinds, the lightning
          cracking over the sky, and even worse. The dragons flying on the
          horizon, and one could think they moved closer each time the lightning
          struck. A sign of the devil if there was one.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Cenric took up a shovel, no need to worry now. God has sent me a bit
          of sun, and the wind is still; all things will be well in God's hand,
          Cenric thought. He pushed the shovel into the earth, but suddenly the
          tintinnabulation from the abbey's bells boomed. It could not be, this
          had never happened, but in the distance, he could hear the shout of
          warriors. Lindisfarne was under attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we put the start of the Viking Age at the raid of the monastery
          of Lindisfarne in 793 CE. This monastery was located on a small island
          in Northumbria. At the time, it was an important place for the
          Catholic faith in Brittain, and many churches saw this location as
          their mother church. But the attack did make a number on the people of
          Britain, and we have details of the attack preserved in two of the
          surviving manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. There's also a
          letter from the scholar Alcuin of York to bishop Higbald in
          Lindisfarne. Alcuin wrote, "The distress of your suffering fills me
          daily with deep grief, when heathens desecrated God's sanctuaries, and
          poured the blood of saints within the compass of the altar, destroyed
          the house of our hope, trampled the bodies of saints in God's temple
          like animal dung in the street."
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the attack can't have started a whole culture, the start date is
          a bit up for discussion. We see a lot of proto-Viking elements during
          the Vendel period, and we might have to ask ourselves if there's a
          need to have a chronological separation between these two periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because some of the typical Viking elements seem to have been far
          spread and established lore in 700 CE, we know this due to the picture
          stones we have found on Gotland, for example. Gotland is an island in
          the Baltic Sea that, through the ages, has been an essential hub for
          particularly trade. However, the picture stones show us that the
          culture and stories we primarily associate with the Vikings were
          established on Gotland, far east of Denmark, Norway, and mainland
          Sweden most likely during 700 CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ten stones were located in the small parish of Ardre on Gotland. Some
          were runestones, and others were picture stones, one of which has
          become known as the V&ouml;lundastone. Scholars, however, will often
          refer to it as Ardre VIII. The name comes from the Poetic Edda and the
          V&ouml;lundarkvi&eth;a, a story that revolves around the smith
          V&ouml;lund and his fate after being taken captive by
          N&iacute;&eth;u&eth;r, the lord of Njarar. Most scholars place this in
          the modern Swedish province of N&auml;rke today in central Sweden. On
          the stone, we can see Odin on Sleipnir, the eight-legged horse, and we
          see V&ouml;lund escaping N&iacute;&eth;u&eth;r. We also see ships that
          give us a bit of insight into how the Viking age sails might have
          looked as.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are more stones, still on Gotland, we find in L&auml;rbro
          perish four phallic-shaped picture stones. Two of them, referred to as
          Stora Hammar I and III, have become somewhat famous due to their
          depictions. On stone one, we have six panels depicting mythological
          and religious functions. The panel that's maybe the most interesting
          is panel three where what's usually thought of as a depiction of
          sacrifices. To the left, hanging from a tree, we see a man hanging; to
          his right, we see another man bent over and another gentleman using
          what seems to be a weapon on his back. Above this scene is a valknut
          and a raven; could it be a blood eagle depicted on this stone? While
          we can't be entirely sure, it can be argued that human sacrifice was
          most likely important in Viking society.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          On the fourth panel, we see what might be a reference to a story from,
          among others, Skaldarskaparm&aacute;l about Hildr. In this panel, we
          see two groups of warriors about to go to war against each other; the
          left side, however, is led by a woman. We find this scene again at a
          different picture stone in Smiss parish on Gotland. We will have to
          talk about women warriors, valkyries, and the amazons of the north in
          another episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          One last panel, and it's on Stora Hammar III, here we can see a
          depiction of Odin stealing the mead of poetry from the giants
          Gunnl&ouml;&eth; and Suttungr. An interesting detail is that the eagle
          in the scene has a beard like Odin. But it shows that what we would
          refer to as Viking culture seems to have been present before the
          attack on Lindisfarne and that the period might need to be
          redefined.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="vikingmeaning">Who is a Viking</h2>
        <p>
          So who would be considered a Viking? If you go online today on your
          social media site of choice and start to read the discussions on
          Vikings, you will hear a lot of claims being thrown around. Some will
          tell you that Viking is not a culture but a job title, some will claim
          it's a culture, and some will, of course, spew neo-nazi junk at you.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how is it then? Is Viking a job, a culture, or something more
          complex? The short answer is yes. When archaeologists or historians
          speak about Vikings, we don't only talk about those who went raiding.
          We often talk about culture. But since we have associated the start of
          the Viking age with raiding, it is not surprising that we named it as
          such. So when we speak about the Vikings, we often talk about a group
          living primarily in modern Scandinavia that shared language, culture,
          and religion. We don't know what the Vikings referred to themself as.
          If you had asked UlfR or Gunnhildr, they would most likely just give
          you the location of where they lived.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We would have gotten different answers if we had asked the people
          living around and near the Vikings what they called them. The most
          common, however, would be pagans or gentiles. They were also called
          Danes in Britain. In today's France, the Vikings were referred to as
          Northmen or Danes. The Irish even separated between the Norwegians,
          who they called Finngall, translating to something like "white
          forigner," and the Danes, referred to as Dubgall. Translating to
          "black forigner."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Swedes didn't often head west but spent more time heading east,
          where they got the names rus or varjag (you might have heard it as
          v&aelig;ringr). While the term rus might sound like it's more likely
          about Russia, the origin of the term might be from Roslagen, the
          coastal area north of Stockholm. We find the rus term for Sweden still
          today in the Finnish language, where Sweden is named Routsi. The word
          could also originate from ro, or rowing since the Swedish Vikings
          often traveled on the rivers where sailing was not always
          possible.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how about the word Viking? What does it mean? To be straight with
          you, there has yet to be an agreement on the word's origin. In 8th
          century English, we find the phrase wicing, but there are question
          marks if this word has the same meaning as Viking. This word also has
          a masculine and a feminine form, so it's v&iacute;kingr and
          v&iacute;king. It translates to sea warrior and an oversea war
          expedition. It can also refer to a person's name or bi name in some
          cases too.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we ask the Internet experts, they will most likely tell you that
          the word's origin comes from these pirates hiding in bays or inlets.
          In Swedish, these are called "vik." It's a simple explanation but not
          satisfying. There are about five main theories for the word's origin;
          this is one. Another would be that they originate from the Norwegian
          hamlet "Viken." Or that it's named after the nautical term for a
          distance called "vika" or a week, it's one of the more unlikely. The
          next contender is the Baltic word "wic," originating from the Latin
          vicus and would be translated to harbor or market. Lastly, you could
          argue a connection with the world for travel or walking, "vikja."
        </p>
        <p>
          None of the above have been proven, and all have flaws. Some more than
          others, but if you hear someone making a claim, you can now put this
          in perspective.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Something more interesting is that Viking is most often used for
          people who went west. I can't say that there's a runic text giving
          this name to the people heading east. For example, we find the
          masculine version of Viking on the Runestone G370 in Hablingbo,
          Gotland.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hvatarr(?) ok Heilgeirr(?) reistu stein eptir Helga, f[ǫ]&eth;ur sinn.
          Hann var [v]estr farinn me&eth; v&iacute;kingum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hvatarr(?) and Heilgeirr(?) raised the stone in memory of Helgi, their
          father. He traveled to the West with the Vikings.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the masculine version, it's clear that Helgi went west with a
          group for war or plunder. Compare this to the feminine version where
          Viking seems to allude more toward an expedition or journey, not
          necessarily war on Vg61.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "T&oacute;la setti stein &thorn;[enna ept]ir Geir, son sinn, har&eth;a
          g&oacute;&eth;an dreng. S&aacute; var&eth; dau&eth;r &aacute;
          vestrvegum &iacute; v&iacute;kingu."
        </p>
        <p>
          "T&oacute;la placed this stone in memory of Geir, her son, a very good
          valiant man. He was killed on the west way in Viking."
        </p>
        <p>
          We see the same word usage in DR330, where the author talks about a
          courageous set of men who went west on Vikings. As I mentioned, Viking
          is mainly connected with the Western path, but exceptions exist. We
          find a stone in Scania, Dr334, that talks about the north. Note the
          feminine version of the term.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fa&eth;ir l&eacute;t hǫggva r&uacute;nar &thorn;essar eptir Ǫzur,
          br&oacute;&eth;ur sinn, er nor&eth;r var&eth; dau&eth;r &iacute;
          v&iacute;kingu."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Father had these runes cut in memory of Assur, his brother, dead up
          north in Viking."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have a strange text to add to this puzzle. It talks about
          Vikings and how a Swede protected the area against them. Here we see
          the masculine form of the word, indicating its sea warriors lead by a
          jarl the stone is talking about. It is from the later part of the
          Viking age and is written from a Christian perspective. The stone in
          question is U 617 and goes as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ginnlaug, Holmgeirs d&oacute;ttir, systir Sigr&oslash;&eth;ar ok
          &thorn;eira Gauts/Gauss, hon l&eacute;t gera br&uacute; &thorn;essa ok
          reisa stein &thorn;enna eptir Ǫzur, b&oacute;nda sinn, son
          H&aacute;konar jarls. S&aacute; var v&iacute;kinga vǫr&eth;r me&eth;
          Geiti(?). Gu&eth; hjalpi hans n&uacute; ǫnd ok s&aacute;lu."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ginnlaug, Holmgeirr's daughter, Sigr&oslash;&eth;r and Gautr's/Gauss'
          sister, she had this bridge made and this stone raised in memory of
          Assur, her husbandman, earl H&aacute;kon's son. He was the viking
          watch with Geitir(?). May God now help his spirit and soul."
        </p>
        <p>
          So there is a clear connection between Viking and warrior, not
          necessarily pirate as some want to interpret the term. But we should
          note how it can also be used as a sea-based exploration term. The most
          exciting part, I believe, is the clear connection with going
          west.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So can we settle the internet dispute about who can call oneself a
          Viking? If we use the Vikings' definition of the word, you need to be
          in the navy or do a lot of sea-based exploration to be calling you a
          Viking. But if we use it as scholars and researchers do, you would
          only need to participate in the practices and culture associated with
          the people living in the Viking age. I think it's important to note
          that words have meaning and can have vastly different meanings
          depending on the era it's used in. So to the Internet Vikings out
          there, feel free to call yourself a Viking. But please note that a
          person from the Viking age would most likely look at you and ask what,
          by Balders balls, you are doing. The exception is that if you are a
          nazi, then you are just a wasted bag of air.
        </p>
        <h2 id="hornedhelmet">Viking and horned helmets&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          Something that's always discussed is if the Viking helmets had horns,
          which is a lingering idea that never seems to go away. Even if these
          type of helmets is slowly disappearing from the public mind, it's a
          glacial process. Sadly, the Vikings did not wear helmets adorned with
          horns into battle while letting out a blood-freezing roar. But the
          idea about the horned helmets is a bit more complex than you might
          initially believe.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The origin of the horned Viking helmet, as we see them today on the
          telly or in comics, has been traced by Roberta Frank to Germany. In
          1876 the preparations for the premiere of Richard Wagner's opera Der
          Ring des Nibelungen were in motion. This opera mixes Norse mythology
          with German medieval ideas, creating the long-lasting idea of German
          heritage being connected to the Viking world. But while the stage was
          being built, the singer practiced the costumes where being made.
          Professor Carl Emil Doepler was the costume designer of the opera, and
          he did something that had not been done before. He put cow horns on
          the helmets the Vikings would wear.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Until 1878 there had not been a single drawing or depiction of Vikings
          with horns on their helmets, but this would change quickly. The image
          spread like a cat meme, and the horned helmet could be found in
          advertisements, paintings, drawings, and even dinner menus.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While horns were new in 1870, the idea of Vikings having lavish
          decorations on their helmets was far from a novel idea. Previous
          depictions of the pagan Vikings were a man wearing a winged helmet,
          taking the viewer's imagination to a place where these pagans
          worshipped nature in a wild state with complete freedom. Horned
          helmets were reserved for the Gauls and Britons.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While nobody had previously depicted Vikings with horns, maybe Doepler
          was basing this on a new find or discovery. The crux here is that we
          have never found a Viking helmet with horns. But to make things
          interesting, horned helmets have been a thing in Scandinavia. The
          issue is that these helmets are connected to the Scandinavian Bronze
          Age. So there are finds of helmets with horns, but they are not Viking
          and were found in a Danish bog in 1942.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The find is known as the Veks&oslash; helmets, a set of nearly
          identical twin helmets. In 2019 birch tar was found in one of the
          horns allowing us to date the helmets with C14. The sample was 20 mg,
          and the calibrated C14 result placed the helmet around 1006&ndash;857
          BCE, firmly within the Late&nbsp; Nordic Bronze Age, where we find
          other objects with horned helmets.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The period between 1000 to 750 BCE contains a lot of figures adorning
          a horned helmet. Often they are in pairs, and a case for twin heroes
          can be made, but we also find these in groups or as lone heroes. On
          what we refer to as Fogdarp yoke, we see a pair of twins with horned
          helmets. Grevensv&aelig;nge figures were a set of bronze figurines
          with horned helmets, and others were in acrobatic poses similar to
          depictions we find in the Minoan culture. We also see these horned
          figures on the Vestrup razor. We find them in bronze-age petroglyphs
          in southern Sweden, such as Tanum. We know some motifs that repeat
          with this horned warrior lifting ships in the air, so this might
          likely be connected to some story of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Helle Vandkilde and others have recently made a compelling case for
          this motif's origin in the Mediterranean. But I think we need a bit
          more evidence before being able to say anything definitely. However,
          this shows that the idea of the Nordic people with horned helmets
          isn't impossible; we just need to put it on the people living 2000
          years before the Vikings.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          And before you write me a comment, there are depictions of figurines
          with horns on the helmet from the Viking and Vendel Ages. We see a
          horned helmed figure on a bronze matrix from &Ouml;land, dating to
          around 500 CE. Then we have three figures that might depict Odin, one
          found in Upp&aring;kra in Scania, another on Levide Gotland, and a
          third found in Starya Ladoga, Russia. Nonetheless, these are not horns
          of the cow variety, and so far, we have not found an actual helmet
          with horns. The Viking helmets we have seen are all built to be used
          in battle. Helmets for rituals seem to have not been in use during
          these periods.
        </p>
        <h2 id="vikingtattoo">Viking Tattoos</h2>
        <p>
          "They are dark from the tips of their toes right up to their
          necks&mdash;trees, pictures, and the like." This is how Ahmad ibn
          Fadlan described the Rūsiyyah he met in the Volga Bulgars capital in
          922 CE. Ibn Fadlan didn't spend much time talking about the Rus body
          art; this is the only known description of what can be assumed to be
          Viking tattoo art. As you note, it is not much at all, and the wording
          ibn Fadlan use here is a bit ambiguous and could be simple body art
          with paint. Or it could be some sort of scarification where some
          substance with color has been added to the wounds. We don't know,
          unfortunately.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have made things easier if we had any tattooing tools
          preserved from the Vikings or any earlier culture, for that matter.
          But in other cultures, tattoo tools are mostly made out of bone or
          other organic material that doesn't last. The exception is the ancient
          Egyptians, who seem to have used needles out of bronze. One argument
          against the Vikings having tattoo tools out of bone is that we find a
          lot of bone combs and other devices from the Viking age. The soil on
          Gotland, for example, is excellent for preserving bone due to the
          chalk-rich dirt. So we find a lot of human skeletons and bone tools
          there, but not something that could be used for tattoo art. We have
          other examples of body art tools from wood or other organic material,
          which could explain why we don't find the tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          But something worth mentioning is that we neither find tattoo art on
          the mummies found in bogs around Denmark and Sweden. Something worth
          mentioning here is that the skin turns dark due to the natural
          processes in the marshes. I've not seen any IR photos of the bodies,
          but this could reveal any hidden tattoos on the skin. This method has
          been used with Scythian corpses frozen in the tundra. And we know that
          tattoos were around in Europe from, for example, &Ouml;tzi, who lived
          on the brink of the early Bronze Age.
        </p>
        <p>
          A lack of evidence is, of course, not evidence for something not
          existing. As I mentioned, we have a witness talking about body art on
          what most likely was Scandinavian Vikings. However, we will need more
          evidence to be able, from a scientific perspective, to say that the
          Vikings had body art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the, as I call them, Instagram Vikings who decorate themselves
          with these "viking tattoos" do not have a Viking tattoo. At most, they
          have a sort of reimagined cosplay of what the Vikings might have had.
          But in many cases, it's not even that but later reimaginations of
          Viking art. Take, for example, the Vegvisir symbol; I know it's a
          popular Viking tattoo, and supposedly, you won't get lost if you have
          it. The issue is that this Vegvisir only can be found in a text by
          Geir Vigfusson in 1860. Vigfusson claims that he got this from an
          Icelandic text called Huld Manuscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vigfusson seems to have lost the original manuscript at one point, or
          he made it up based on later Icelandic magical symbols. Historiska
          Museet in Stockholm has a short book of 35 pages with magic signs from
          Iceland in its collection. They resemble a bit some of Vigfusson's
          depictions, but this book was written around 1600 CE. So a bit after
          the Viking age. This manuscript is fascinating because magic seems to
          have still been practiced and survived the witch processes in
          Scandinavia and Iceland.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of them are the Vegvisir, however. In my opinion, these symbols
          are a mishmash of later Christian thought and Viking-inspired art. I
          find it most likely that Geir made the Huld manuscript up later to
          sell his story when esoterism was on the rise.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you like the symbol, nothing stops you from getting it tattooed on
          your body. A word of caution, however, most of the signs you find
          online often have some runes written around the symbols. Nearly all I
          saw on my quick perusing had the Futhark written around them. Futhark
          is basically the Viking ABC. While it might be better than spelling
          out soup, don't think this has any more profound meaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have the Viking tattoos that are not Viking tattoos and that
          you should not get. The chin tattoo is maybe the first that comes to
          mind. We find it, for example, with the Moari, called "Ta moko," and
          among the indigenous people of Alaska and Canada. In H&auml;n Gwich'in
          the chin tattoos are referred to as Yidįįłtoo; the I&ntilde;upiaq call
          these marking Tavlugun, and in the arctic regions, it's named
          Kakiniit. We should remember that these symbols have a deep meaning
          for the people in these cultures. Often, practices such as tattooing,
          religion, and other traditions have been forgotten in an attempt to
          remove them. So please don't get a chin tattoo if you don't belong to
          these groups. I've seen the TikTok filter that includes the chin mark,
          and just don't use it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          H&auml;n Gwich'in and I&ntilde;upiaq have the right to their culture,
          and it is rightfully a closed practice. There is zero evidence that
          the Vikings would have had these markings, and if we listen to the
          only account we have about Viking body art, they did not paint above
          the neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to look like a Viking, the tattoo route is uncertain. What
          we do know is that they did file their teeth. Usually, we find
          horizontal grooves on the Viking teeth bringing them a bit of a unique
          aesthetic. So there you have it. If you want to be a Viking, you might
          have to do dental work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Filing your teeth might be a bit much for you, and some might still
          want a tattoo. Then I recommend you look up Peter Oakmund Madsen and
          his Tattoo studio Northen Black. He has published some books with
          Viking-inspired motifs that catch the Viking art while adapting to
          work as awesome tattoos.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="woolandsteel">Wool and steel</h2>
        <p>
          Most of you might associate the Vikings with fearsome warriors, which
          has been the public perception for many years. But as research and
          archaeology went forward, this picture started to change. While the
          Vikings enjoyed raiding a monastery or two, another image developed.
          The Vikings were tradesmen who sold goods and services for silver,
          gold, and other goods not found in the cold north. The truth is most
          likely that the Vikings were opportunistic; they raided where the
          raiding was good and traded where the trade would be the most
          beneficial.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Was this life something that the majority of the population enjoyed? I
          hear, particularly online, that the Vikings were farmers, just looking
          to expand their farmland. While farming was most likely necessary for
          many to be self-sufficient, animal husbandry would likely have been
          more important for society. As Professor Niel Price pointed out, the
          Viking society depended on wool. Most clothing was made out of yarn;
          maybe even more important, the ship's sails were made entirely of
          wool.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Scandinavian ship technologies were improving rapidly, the
          sail was the biggest key to success. It seems to have been introduced
          quite late up here in the north, not earlier than 700 CE. These sails
          were square and created out of wool strips sewn together horizontally
          or vertically. Making them more wind resistant was done by adding a
          contexture of tar, tallow, fat, and other greasy substances.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how much wool would they need for a sail? A large ship would need
          a sail containing about one-kilo wool per square meter. A medium-sized
          boat, however, would get away with maybe an 80 square meter sail
          clocking in at about 50 kilos. Add to this all the clothes the sailors
          need for the open sea and at land, the reserve sail, tents, and rugs.
          The amount of wool starts to add up. The Scandinavian sheep during
          this time produced about one kilo per year. So to fit a ship with all
          the items required and a crew of 32 sailors or more, if the vessels
          were larger, we would need rather big herds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then add the work of crafting all this fabric; there were no machines,
          so it required humans to do all the work. Textile archaeologists have
          calculated that a two-person team could create one of the medium-sized
          sails in about one year, working 10 hours a day. So that's a single
          sail; as I mentioned, you would not go out without a backup. Now we're
          up at two years and four people. Then add all the other stuff they
          would require and that some fleets during the height of the Viking age
          could be of over 200 ships. Calculations have been made, and the
          amount of cloth used for sailing in Scandinavia might have been around
          one million square meters. That's quite an amount of sheep required.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's unlikely that free people did this work, and it might even
          explain the origin of raiding in Scandinavia. To get slaves, or
          thralls, to work the textile mills. Toward the later Viking Age, we
          see farms merging. Before, it was thought to be due to migration or
          war, but now it seems as if families have started to go together to
          get enough land for these large sheep herds. But during this time, we
          also find weaving huts on the premises. They are often sunken down in
          the ground and seem to have been harsh work environments. It's hard to
          see a free woman spending 10 hours every day ruining their lungs and
          eyesight. So, raiding became necessary to support textile production
          for the increasing ship production. The Scandinavians seem to have
          created a vicious circle for themselves.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="vikingclass">Classy Vikings</h2>
        <p>
          We have mentioned thralls here and the Scandinavian slave trade, but
          how did the Vikings structure their society? Can we see any classes or
          where they equals? Reading the materials left to us, we can
          disguisings three levels in Scandinavian society. At the lowest, we
          find the thralls or enslaved people, who most likely comprised a
          fourth of the population. These were people without rights and freedom
          and were kind of left to the whims of their masters. Then we have the
          free people, who could vary from prosperous merchants to two-goat
          cottages barely scraping by. This class made up the vast majority of
          the population. Lastly, we have the elite, the two percenters of
          society.
        </p>
        <p>
          These classes have quite an exciting origin story within Viking
          mythology. If we read R&iacute;gs&thorn;ula, we are offered quite the
          insight into the Scandinavian view on class and society. In this
          story, we follow the god Heimdahl, who wanders the earth in the
          disguise of R&iacute;gr. On his journey, he met an old couple called
          Great-Grandmother and Great-Grandfather. R&iacute;gr is served a heavy
          thick loaf of bread and meat and sleeps between the old couple. Nine
          months later, the Great-Grandmother gave birth to a son that they
          named &THORN;r&aelig;ll. In the saga, this child is described as this.
        </p>
        <p>"He began to grow and to thrive well;</p>
        <p>on his hands there</p>
        <p>was wrinkled skin,</p>
        <p>knotted knuckles, . . .</p>
        <p>thick fingers,</p>
        <p>he had an ugly face,</p>
        <p>a crooked back, long heels."</p>
        <p>
          &THORN;r&aelig;ll was then, well, not married since he was a slave,
          but coupled with &THORN;&iacute;r. She was a slave girl with dirty
          feets, sunburned, and a bent nose. &THORN;r&aelig;ll and
          &THORN;&iacute;r are then connected with specific tasks and labor
          within the saga.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Heimdal or R&iacute;gr continued his journey and met another couple in
          a hall with a cozy fire burning; the Grandfather and the Grandmother
          were well-kempt and in good physiques. Again R&iacute;gr was served
          food, a bit better this time, and slept between the couple. Nine
          months later, the son Karl (this name would translate to the
          householder) was born and was described as having lively eyes, red
          hair, and a healthy color on the skin.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Karl is then associated with the free people, and we learn again that
          this class is supposed to do specific jobs. Lastly, Heimdal comes to
          the last hall, a grand construction with its ports vetting south. The
          couple here is even more beautiful and dressed in finer clothes than
          the precious couple. This time Heimdal is served roasted birds and the
          best cuts from the pig on silver plates and gets fine wine with the
          meal. Again, since even the ultra-wealthy didn't have guest rooms,
          Heimdal slept between the man and wife. Nine months later, surprise,
          the son Jarl (Earl) was born dressed in fine silk, with blond hair,
          bright cheeks, and piercing eyes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Earl grew up there on the benches;</p>
        <p>he began to swing linden shields, fit bow strings,</p>
        <p>bend the elm-bow, put shafts on arrows,</p>
        <p>hurl a javelin, brandish Frankish spears,</p>
        <p>ride horses, urge on hounds,</p>
        <p>wield swords, practice swimming.</p>
        <p>
          From this saga, we can tell there seem to have been three crucial
          qualities in Scandinavian society: appearance, capabilities, and
          influence. What is also interesting to note here is that compared to
          the Greek pantheon, where a child of a god would have extraordinary
          power, none of the children seem to have received these gifts
          here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I also find it fascinating the stark contrast between ibn Fadlan's
          description of Scandinavian hygiene, the archaeological record, sagas,
          and chroniclers like John of Wallingford. In comparison, ibn Fadlan
          has nothing nice to say about the Viking way of hygiene, but the
          archeological record indicates that they cared about their looks. A
          comb was a necessity in Scandinavian society; add tweezers, razors,
          and scissors. The statues we have found depict people with twirled
          mustaches, finely trimmed beards, and nicely cut hair. The chronicler,
          John of Wallingford, described the Scandinavians as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "According to their contry's costums - in the habit of combing their
          hair every day, to bathe every Saturday, to change their clothes
          frequently and to draw attention to themsleves by means of many such
          frivolous whims. In this way, they besiged the married women's virtue
          and persuaded the daughters of even noble men to become their
          misresses."
        </p>
        <p>
          So looks were important in Scandinavian society and could very well
          affect your status and how far you could move in society. There was
          mobility to some extent, especially if you could prove yourself
          capable and increase your wealth and influence. Mostly this mobility
          was reserved for the people of the free men, but it did happen that
          enslaved people could be released from their bondage. We even have two
          runestones that former or current slaves ordered. For example, on
          Adels&ouml;, just outside Birka, we find one stone carved on the order
          by Tolir. He refers to himself as Bryti, a special class of thrall,
          and he could claim this stone with his wife by right. Usually, thralls
          could not have wives, but one could question if Tolir was now
          free.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example in Denmark is where T&oacute;ki, the blacksmith,
          raised a stone in memory of his former master, who gave him freedom
          and gold. Even if these were free men, they would not have been equal
          to the born free men. In some sense, the thralls would always be a
          thrall in the eye of the law. It might have been even worse for the
          women since most of the slave trade seems to have focused on sex
          trafficking. If you want to wash away the picture of the brave Viking
          warrior, you should read ibn Fadlan's account. It is a gruesome tale,
          I must warn you. We will have to return to the Viking age and focus
          more on the women in their society. We did not get around to this now,
          but I see at least one full episode only on women in Scandinavian
          culture, and there are undoubtedly a couple of myths we can expel
          there too.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Next time we will be back investigating our alien overlords in one way
          or another.
