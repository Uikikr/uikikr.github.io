        <hr />
        <p>This article received an update on 11/5 2023</p>
        <p>
          Let's talk about AI-generated images and stories. You might have seen
          a recent report on social media accompanied by old-timey pictures of
          the great explorer Alfred Isaac Middleton. The spelling varies with
          one or two "D" in the last name. These pictures are usually
          accompanied by a story that goes something like this:
        </p>
        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 15%; margin-left: 10px">
          <img
            src="img/06.jpg"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt="AI generated picture of the fake city Dawleetoo"
          />
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            <p>Some claim this is Dawleetoo</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          "<em
            >British explorer Alfred Isaac Midleton (Or Middleton) traveled the
            farthest reaches of the globe during the late 19th century in search
            of zoological, botanical, and archeological wonders. These recently
            unearthed photographs help to shed light on some of his amazing
            discoveries during several missions to then-uncharted regions of
            Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Unfortunately, all of his journals and scientific writings were
            lost in 1901 when Midleton and his team vanished during a Sumatran
            expedition to uncover the fabled Lost City of Dawleetoo. Due to
            these tragic events, scant details are known about what you see in
            these fascinating photos.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Picture this: a mysterious story with clues hidden in plain sight. It
          starts with the protagonist's name, A.I. Middleton, which seems
          innocent enough. But take a closer look; you'll see it's a clue to the
          story's origin. Artificial Intelligence Middleton. Add in the city of
          <em>Dawleetoo</em>, a play on the name of Dall-e II, and suddenly the
          mystery deepens.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the author doesn't stop there. The story's construction is
          downright clever. You see, Middleton wasn't just any name plucked from
          thin air. It was the name of a real-life archaeologist and museum
          director during the 1800s. John Henry Middleton, to be exact. And get
          this: in 2011, an
          <a href="http://middletonas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >archaeological society</a
          >
          was named after him. It's almost as if the author is trying to make
          the story more believable by using a name that resembles a genuine
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's little details like these that make this story so intriguing. Who
          knows what other secrets are waiting to be uncovered?

          Some of the stories seem inspired by the adventurer Percy Fawcett, who
          we will get to in a moment, and a document called "Manuscript 512."
          The document's real name is "Rela&ccedil;&atilde;o hist&oacute;rica de
          huma oculta, e grande Povoa&ccedil;&atilde;o, antiguissima sem
          moradores, que se descubrio no anno de 1753" or in English,
          "Historical relation of an occult, large, very old settlement with no
          inhabitants that was found in the year 1753." The record was
          discovered in 1839 in the National Library of Brazil by Manuel
          Ferreira Lagos.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, the manuscript contains twelve pages written by an unknown
          author and seems to be part of a letter. The tale within the pages
          follows a group of "Bandeirantes," another name for slavers/explorers
          in Brazil, and their discovery of an abandoned city in the state of
          Bahia. The short version goes as follows.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >As they journeyed through the rugged terrain, a contingent led by a
            Portuguese colonel chanced upon a breathtaking sight: a deserted
            settlement perched atop a high mountain range. The entrance to this
            mysterious city was adorned with a Roman-looking triple archway and
            etched with cryptic inscriptions in an unknown language, shrouding
            the place in an aura of enigma. As they ventured further into the
            city, they came upon a square dominated by a black pedestal bearing
            a statue of a man pointing resolutely northwards. An expansive
            building, resplendent with intricate reliefs and inlaid works
            depicting crosses, crows, and other intricate designs, loomed
            nearby. The magnificent street portico was graced by a relief
            carving of a half-naked figure sporting a laurel crown, imbuing the
            place with an air of regal majesty.&nbsp;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Undaunted, the group explored the abandoned mineshafts and were
            astounded to discover rocks infused with silver and inscriptions
            that defied their attempts at decipherment. Their discovery of a
            sprawling countryside manor was even more astonishing, replete with
            untold secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. In their quest
            for riches, they tested the soil near the nearby river and were
            rewarded with a bounty of gold flecks. Despite the allure of wealth,
            the author pauses to reflect on the deserted city's strange and
            curious state and marvels at the fauna that now inhabits the ruins.
            As the group searched the town, one expedition member found a
            remarkable treasure - a gold coin portraying a young boy kneeling on
            one side and a bow, arrow, and crown on the other.</em

          As we delve deeper into the annals of history, we often find that the
          intersection of nationalism and "alternative history" is a theme that
          rears its head time and time again. And so it was when the Brazilian
          Historic and Geographic Institute received the details of the
          enigmatic Manuscript 512.
        </p>
        <p>
          With hopes of uncovering evidence of a Greco-Roman culture to bolster
          their newly-formed Brazilian identity, expeditions were launched in
          search of the lost city the manuscript purportedly detailed. Alas, all
          efforts were in vain. But the document's legacy would prove to be
          far-reaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manuscript 512 became a source of inspiration for many in the arts and
          literature. Perhaps most famously, it was the foundation for Sir
          Arthur Conan Doyle's novel "<a
            href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-lost-world"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>The lost World,</em></a
          >" published in 1912. And it was also entwined in the lore of Percy
          Fawcett's search for the lost city of Z.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doyle also appears in some of the more elaborate versions of the
          Middleton story. Or rather, Doyle's assistant is claimed to have kept
          a cache of documents safe about Alfred Middleton. The age of the
          assistant is a bit vague, but some articles of a bit dubious origin
          claim that this assistant should have sent or received an email about
          this. A claim that would be impressive since Doyle's assistant, Alfred
          H. Wood, died in 1941.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the realm of alternative history, tall tales, and half-truths often
          capture the public's imagination. One such account involves the
          supposed cache of documents kept by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
          assistant, which is always unnamed within the accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are many holes in this narrative. Some articles with
          dubious origins claim that this assistant either sent or received an
          email about these documents to or from the British consulate. But
          considering that we know that Doyle's assistant was Alfred H. Wood,
          who died in 1941, the likelihood of such an email is slim to none.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all of this leads us to Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Fawcett. A
          fascinating person who might be the main inspiration for the Indiana
          Jones character. Fawcett also became friends with Arthur Conan Doyle,
          who based some of his books on Fawcett.
        </p>
        <p>
          Percy Fawcett was a man cut from a different cloth. After retiring
          from the military in 1906, he became obsessed with exploring the
          uncharted wilderness of Brazil. In a time when being an adventurer was
          an actual job title, Fawcett mounted seven expeditions between 1906
          and 1924, earning a reputation as a capable explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fawcett had a different approach toward the indigenous people of the
          Amazon than others. He treated the locals respectfully and patiently,
          offering gifts on contact to be better accepted. This set him somewhat
          apart from other explorers in the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even a man like Fawcett couldn't escape the pull of war. When
          World War I broke out, he reenlisted at the age of 50, leaving his
          explorations behind and heading back to Britain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1925, Fawcett embarked on his final expedition to find the City of
          Z, accompanied by his son Jack and Jack's friend, Raleigh Rimmel. They
          were last seen on May 29, 1925, entering the jungle in search of the
          lost city. Despite numerous search and rescue missions, no trace of
          Fawcett or his team was ever found, and their disappearance remains a
          mystery. The last known location of the party was at the Horse Shoe
          Camp, where Fawcett wrote one of his last known letters.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The theories around Fawcett's disappearance range from dying from
          starvation, exhaustion, and being killed by one of the tribes in the
          area to being sucked into a time warp or kidnapped by aliens. In the
          most likely hood, they got hit by disease or had an accident that
          killed them. But in 1979, Fawcett's signet ring turned up in a
          pawnshop within the small city of Cuiab&aacute;. Located in the
          southwest of Brazil. This, of course, led to speculations that bandits
          were behind his disappearance. Until we find the expeditions bodies,
          we won't have any specific answers, but the jungles have claimed
          people in the past and will continue to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at pictures of Percy Fawcett, we're met by a grave man with a
          steely gaze. He could almost be likened to a mysterious wilderness
          guide, living off the land and keeping to himself in a Victorian
          post-apocalyptic world. It's also abundantly clear that Fawcett is the
          inspiration for the stories when we look at the pictures accompanying
          the posts. Among the photos is a portrait of a man with a beard, a
          straight nose, and a piercing stare wearing a pith helmet. If we
          compare this face with the pictures we have of Fawcett, there is no
          doubt that this portrait is based on Fawcett's photographs.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I want to warn you, dear listeners, that some don't let facts get
          in the way of a good story in the world of alternative history. We've
          seen it before, and we'll see it again. Sensationalistic blogs like
          "Lost Books" and "Mysteries Unsolved" have been quick to jump on the
          Middleton bandwagon, but let's take a closer look at one of their
          supposed sources, shall we? They claim a book called "The Lost Casket
          of Dawleetoo" supposedly contains the story of Middleton, gold
          statues, and the lost city. They even named the author, a
          <a
            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/authors/search/?query=Du+Boisgobey,+Fortun%c3%a9"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Frenchman named Fortun&eacute; du Boisgobey.&nbsp;</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the thing, folks. While Fortun&eacute; du Boisgobey was a
          real author, he never wrote about Dawleetoo or Alfred Isaac Middleton.
          In 1881 du Boisgobey published a book called La Main coup&eacute;e; in
          its English translation, it is called
          <a
            href="https://archive.org/details/lostcasket00boisgoog/page/n10/mode/2up"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>The lost casket</em></a
          >. This book is available on the Internet Archive and Gutenburg
          Project for free, but I must warn you. It is not as exciting as these
          alternative history blogs make it out to be.

          So, with all of this knowledge, we could be pretty confident when
          declaring the story and the pictures a hoax. But all this research
          might have been a bit overkill. Since we do know who did create both
          the account and the photos. On July 29, 2022, Visual Effects
          Supervisor Mitch Gates posted on his Facebook wall. The post got
          little traction compared to later reposts, but it is the origin of the
          whole concept. The post even contained the hashtag #midjourney.&nbsp;

          Mich Gates has created quite a lot of these AI-generated pictures. One
          set depicts what we are supposed to think is the set for the faked
          moon landing conspiracy theory. While another explores a hypothetical
          future where artificial intelligence has replaced human creativity,
          leading to the downfall of art stores and the displacement of creative
          professionals. These thought-provoking images offer a unique
          perspective on the impact of technological advancements on society and
          the arts.

          On August 3, 2022, Mich Gates even complained about "another share who
          forgot to credit." So it seems clear that we have the story's origin
          right here with Mich. From what I can tell, it was never intended to
          fool somebody or deceive. It was a fun thought experiment visualized
          by Midjourney with some tongue-in-cheek text added to give the
          pictures an additional flavor.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look closer at the photographs made by Gates, you will notice a
          lot of AI artifacts since these seem to not have been edited
          afterward. AI, at this point, also struggled with portraying humans,
          so all portraits look odd to the human eye. As the technology advance,
          this might not be the case in the future, and something you will need
          to keep an eye on. While we have struggled with Photoshop for some
          time, AI art has the potential for even more hoaxes. Gone are the days
          when a picture could be accepted as is. The gen five of Midjourney can
          create photo-realistic renderings of prompts you feed them on a level
          where it's tough to tell it apart from reality.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you don't trust the source, you should definitely not trust any
          pictures from there. Even if it's a trusted source, you must do some
          investigations before accepting it since they could have been duped.
          While being a skeptic has become even more challenging, we should take
          pride that it's never been more critical.

          This would have been where I told you, listener, that all of this was
          written by an AI. And I did try to use ChatGTP to write this but
          first. Fortunately, or unfortunately, Gates created the Middleton
          story too recently, so it's not part of what ChatGTP knows. So I tried
          giving it the information I wanted to use, but the issue was that the
          AI started to make things up anyway to a point where it's started to
          create even more sources for Alfred Isaac Middleton that don't exist.
          When I called the bot out on it, I only got excuses and that it would
          try to do better in the future.

          The AI tools are great if you really know the material you work with
          and looking to improve your texts. But as a research assistant or a
          replacement for searching Google? Then it can be outright dangerous.
          While we have added the word intelligence to this type of bot, we must
          remember that it does not really understand things and can't separate
          between good and bad information.
