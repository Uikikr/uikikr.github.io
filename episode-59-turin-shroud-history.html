          Since we are so close to Easter, maybe it's time to discuss something
          connected to the holiday. So why not the Shroud of Turin? Some claim
          the cloth carries the image of Jesus Christ, and others have pointed
          out that making a copy of it is relatively simple. And yes, Ancient
          Aliens are using the shroud as evidence for their alien hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we will deal with the cloth's historical events, from its
          shrouded origin to initial accusations of being a hoax and its journey
          to Turin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Oh, hello, I didn't see you there. Welcome to Digging Up Ancient
          Aliens. This is the podcast where we examine strange claims about
          alternative history and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 59, and I'm your host, Fredrik. Since we are so
          close to Easter, maybe it's time to discuss something connected to the
          holiday. So why not the Shroud of Turin? Some claim the cloth carries
          the image of Jesus Christ, and others have pointed out that making a
          copy of it is relatively simple. And yes, Ancient Aliens are using the
          shroud as evidence for their alien hypothesis.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Our exploration of the Turin Shroud will be divided into two parts,
          trying to make things easier to follow. Today, we will deal with the
          cloth's historical events, from its shrouded origin to initial
          accusations of being a hoax and its journey to Turin. Next, we will
          look more at the studies and tests performed in modern times, such as
          the famous photos and the C14 testing by S.Tu.R.P. in 1988.&nbsp;
        </p>

          I've also done something a bit unusual: I translated some documents
          from Latin to English. While I quote bits, you can find the full
          version on the website.

        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="describingshroud">Describing the shroud</h2>
        <p>
          So, where do we begin a story and examination of something like the
          Shroud of Turin? An excellent place to start, I guess, is to describe
          it. As usual, we will begin looking at this through the eyes of the
          Ancient Alien promoters. I want you to pay close attention to how they
          discuss and choose to present the Shroud of Turin throughout the
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Shroud of Turin is a piece of ancient linen cloth, measures
            about 14 feet long by three and a half feet wide, and what's so
            important about this cloth is, there's a very faint imprint of a
            human being on the cloth who appears to have been crucified, which
            matches the biblical descriptions of Jesus Christ. So, many believe
            that this shroud, this relic, is the actual burial cloth of Jesus
            Christ, and bears the wounds of crucifixion</em
          >." – John de Salvo, Ph.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that's the basic information about the Turin Shroud, a piece of
          linen cloth 4.4 meters long and one meter wide. Upon this cloth,
          yellow with age and riddled with holes, we can see a weak imprint of
          the front and back of what appears to be a man. His hand is laid so
          that it covers his private parts, and the soles of his feet have left
          an imprint on the cloth. Somehow, the hollow of the knee is still
          visible. So this is the basics regarding the Turin Shroud and
          something everyone can agree upon. Most things other than this are not
          often as clear. How would a believer describe our understanding of the
          Turin Shroud, then? Luckily, we have Father William Fulco, who can
          help us with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Shroud of Turin has such a fascinating history, and the
            question is: Is it authentic? Those who are against it say, no, this
            could easily have been a fake, and a body would never have left such
            an image and so on. The chemicals of an embalmed body would not have
            done such a thing. But the people who say that are not able to
            explain how the figure did get there. It's not painted. It doesn't
            seem to be a pigment that's applied to the cloth.</em
          >" – Fr. William J. Fulco, Ph.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proving the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin has been the goal of
          Sindonologists for a long time. In the 1950s, investigations of the
          Turin Shroud were looked at as if they were its own discipline, and
          the term Sindonology was adopted for this perceived new field. It will
          become evident that while Sindonology sounds scientific, it's not
          really. Like the many pseudo-scientific claims we look into, this
          discipline usually starts at its preferred result and tries to work
          backward to find evidence that fits. As we look into the allegations
          and history of the Turin Shroud, we will see a lot of cherry-picking,
          moving of goalposts, and several other logical fallacies. We will see
          how evidence is strangely ruled out, and the claim that nobody can
          explain how the image appeared will be a mantra that is so often
          repeated. We already have two quotes from the show, yet we don't know
          anything about the Turin Shroud history or what's going on and what's
          been examined. So let's change this.
        </p>
        <h2 id="shroudsofjesus">The shrouds of Jesus</h2>
        <p>
          Let's shift into the history and the beginning of the Shroud of Turin.
          You might wonder why I and the literature always use the term Turin
          Shroud, often shortened to TS, or the Shroud of Turin. If this would
          be the burial shroud of Jesus, why not call it the shroud or the
          shroud of Jesus? That's because, as with other relics, there are
          several shrouds out there that are claimed to be Jesus's shroud. The
          Turin Shroud is just the most known. As with many relics, the churches
          are cluttered with these items, like the pile of clothes on a
          teenager's bed. Theologian John Calvin opined over the amount of True
          Crosses in existence in 1543. He wrote, "<em
            >In short, if we were to collect all these pieces of the true cross
            exhibited in various parts, they would form a whole ship's
            cargo.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          John Calvin was not a fan of those out to deceive with these relics;
          he portrays them quite harshly like snake oil salesmen. His words were
          not kinder when he, in "<em>Treatise on Relics</em>," talks about the
          numerous shrouds in existence:
          <em
            >"For whoever admitted the reality of one of these sudaries shown in
            so many places must have considered the restas wicked impostures set
            up to deceive the public by the pretense that they were each the
            real sheet in which Christ's body had been wrapped.</em
          >" So, there seem to be several shrouds in existence in 1543, and
          Clavin was not buying it continuing. "<em
            >But it is not only that the exhibitors of this one and the same
            relic give each other mutually the lie, they are (what is far more
            important) positively contradicted by the Gospel.</em
          >" So, how many shrouds have there been? It's not an easy question to
          answer, but in "Relics of the Christ," Joe Nickells cited Thomas
          Humber as having 42 known shrouds in medieval Europe. We have, for
          example, the Shroud of Compiègne, which was widely visited and
          celebrated. It was, however, lost during the French Revolution when a
          taste of ash, dust, and freedom filled the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another example would be the Holy Shroud of Caduin, brought to France
          by the Crusaders in 1098. Surviving wars and revolutions, it was
          worshipped until 1935 when, as Nickells and Humber point out, the
          ornamental bands on the Holy Shroud consisted of Khufic writings with
          Muslim blessings. The message mentioned that the textile had been
          created for the vizier of the Caliph of Cairo, who fought during the
          First Crusade. We also have accounts of a Holy Shroud of
          Constantinople, supposedly later split into pieces and sent across the
          continent. Another famous example is the Holy Shroud of Besançon.
          Unfortunately, it met the same fate as the Shroud of Compiègne and was
          swallowed by the flames of the revolution. An intriguing thing
          regarding the Besançon shroud is that while the fabric is no longer,
          we have depictions of it. A 17th-century engraving shows the shroud,
          and this depiction does look eerily similar to the Turin Shroud.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When Sindonologists discuss the Turin Shroud, they rarely mention that
          there are several competing shrouds. The Turin Shroud seems to have
          taken the lead due to its great publicity, which you will see later.
          For now, though, I think we should shift our attention to the shroud's
          history—a history that, again, is often left out of the narrative by
          believers.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The story in front of us doesn't start in the small town of Turin in
          Italy but in France. To be precise, in a small village named Lirey, a
          skip and a stone southeast of Paris. While we know where it starts,
          the when is a bit shrouded in mystery. As Nickell points out, there
          are accounts mentioning 1353 as the year the Turin Shroud entered the
          scene. According to this version, Geoffroy de Charny, a knight of
          honor and chivalry, presented the shroud to the Dean of the Lirey
          Abbey. De Charny then built the Church of Our Lady of Lirey to store
          this relic. The issue regarding this claim is that, while the church
          was built, an inventory taken during 1357 doesn't mention the shroud.
          To be fair, de Charny could have kept the fabric at home for some
          reason. What we know for sure is that the Shroud of Turin went up on
          display in 1357 and was advertised as the "<em
            >real burial cloth of Jesus Christ.</em
          >"&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The advertising worked, and soon, pilgrims started to flock to Lirey.
          Pilgrims that brought money with them. Humans have not changed much,
          and our love for knicknacks and souvenirs seems to have not changed.
          Of course, the little wooden Church of Our Lady was prepared for this
          and had little medallions struck. A small, and most likely rather
          expensive, token to remember the visit by. Two known Lirey Pilgrim's
          badges are still in existence; one was found in the Seine River in
          1855 by a man named Forgeais. The actual mold was found in 2009.
          Unfortunately, it was uncovered by a group of hobby metal detectorists
          operating against French law. Something Ian Wilson discovered when
          researching the mold. This object is still in private possession.
          Looking at the badge, however, we see that the print seems more
          visible. It's not the faint picture we see today. Again, it resembles
          the Besançon shroud in how it is depicted.&nbsp;

          The money and claims about the relic would gain the church's
          attention. 1389, Bishop Pierre d'Arcis launched the first
          investigation into the Turin Shroud. In a letter to the first
          anti-pope of Avignon, Clement VII, d'Arcis wrote about his suspicions
          and the evidence he had accumulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The case, Holy Father, stands thus. Some time since in this diocese
            of Troyes the Dean of a certain collegiate church, to wit, that of
            Lirey, falsely and deceitfully, being consumed with the passion of
            avarice, and not from any motive of devotion but only of gain,
            procured for his church a certain cloth cunningly painted, upon
            which by a clever sleight of hand was depicted the twofold image of
            one man, that is to say, the back and front, he falsely declaring
            and pretending that this was the actual shroud in which our Savior
            Jesus Christ was enfolded in the tomb. This story was put about not
            only in the kingdom of France, but, so to speak, throughout the
            world, so that from all parts people came together to view it. And
            further to attract the multitude so that money might cunningly be
            wrung from them, pretended miracles were worked, certain men being
            hired to represent themselves as healed at the moment of the
            exhibition of the shroud, which all believed to be the shroud of our
            Lord.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Pierre d'Arcis is quite straightforward and doesn't spare words. The
          shroud was a forgery. In this memorandum preserved for us, d'Arcis
          continues to state what his investigation had revealed: that the
          burial cloth was made by human hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Eventually, after diligent inquiry and examination, he discovered
            the fraud and how the said cloth had been cunningly painted, the
            truth being attested by the artist who had painted it, to wit, that
            it was a work of human skill and not miraculously wrought or
            bestowed."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretty daming accusations. The bishop confidently asserts that de
          Charny lied about and forged the burial cloth from the beginning. So
          what did come out of all of this? Nothing. This does not mean he did
          not try; d'Arcis certainly tried, as we will see. But he was a little
          bit unlucky, to say the least. In late July 1389, the bishop contacted
          Pope Clement VII. From what we can tell, he quickly felt side-lined
          and tried to bypass the ecclesiastic route by going straight to King
          Charles VI. The King took the Bishop's suspicions seriously. He sent
          out his bailiffs to siege the cloth presented as the burial vestments
          for Jesus. The knights did an honest try but were not allowed into the
          treasury by the Dean of the church. They put a seal on the door and
          went to dinner; the next day, Dean Nicole Martin filed official
          appeals, and the knights let the whole thing go. It is worth
          mentioning that around this time, Geoffrey II de Charney was part of
          the King's entourage for the coronation of Queen Isabel of Batavia.
          Having direct access to the King's ear might explain why the bailiffs
          quickly gave up recovering the shroud.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1389, the head of the de Charny household was Geoffrey II, the son
          of the original alleged custodian of the Turin Shroud. Unknown to the
          Bishop, Pope Clement VII, and Geoffrey had close family ties. As
          Shorud proponent Ian Wilson put it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Before Clement became Pope he had been known as Robert of Geneva.
            His father was the cousin of Aimon of Geneva, Geoffrey II de
            Charny's stepfather, who had died the year before. Geoffrey II de
            Charny was thereby 'family' for Clement. And although we cannot be
            certain that he and Geoffrey were actually together at the time
            Bishop d'Arcis's letter arrived in Avignon, the family tie certainly
            goes some way to explaining what happened next.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          On January 5, 1390, Clement VII sent a letter and a Papal bull.
          Instead of being approved to investigate the matter further, the
          bishop d'Arcis was ordered to leave the matter and remain silent under
          the threat of excommunication. These letters have been preserved in a
          few copies; one is stored in the National Library in Paris and one in
          the Vatican Archives. While the bishop is ordered to let this go, the
          Pope seems to somewhat believe d'Arcis. In the letter, we can read
          that the church:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >/.../shall not perform any solemnities that are accustomed to be
            performed in showing relics, and that therefore no torches, lights,
            or candles should be lit for any solemnity, nor any lights
            whatsoever be used there for that purpose, and that the one showing
            the said figure, when a larger crowd of people has gathered there,
            should at least sometimes, while a sermon is being given there,
            publicly proclaim to the people in a loud and intelligible voice,
            with all deceit ceasing, that they do not show the said figure or
            representation as the true Shroud of Our Lord Jesus Christ, but as a
            figure or representation of the said Shroud, which is said to be of

          Lingonen. and Eduen. and Cathalaunen. officials, greetings and
          apostolic blessing. — Some time ago, on behalf of our beloved son, the
          nobleman Gaufridi, lord of the place of Lireyo, of the diocese of
          Troyes, it was explained to us that recently, on behalf of our beloved
          son Peter, cardinal priest of the title of Saint Susanna, on behalf of
          the same Gaufridi, it was explained that formerly out of zeal for
          devotion of his father etc., as is more fully contained in our letters
          made on this subject up to the previous point. We, seeking to provide
          for the manner of such display, to remove all matter of error and
          idolatry, by apostolic authority, have decreed and also ordained that
          whenever the said figure or representation happened to be shown to the
          people, the dean and chapter of the aforementioned and other
          ecclesiastical persons showing such figure or representation, and
          being present at such display, should perform no solemnities which are
          accustomed to be done in displaying relics, and that for this reason
          neither twisted candles, torches, nor candles should be lit for any
          solemnity, nor should any lights whatsoever be used there, and that
          the one showing the said figure, whenever a large multitude of people
          gathered there, at least whenever a sermon happened to be given there,
          should publicly address and say to the people in a clear and
          intelligible voice, with all deceit ceasing, that the aforementioned
          figure or representation was not being shown as the true shroud of our
          Lord Jesus Christ, but as a figure or representation of the said
          shroud, which is said to be of the same Lord Jesus Christ of ours. We
          decree that if they did not observe our said will, decree, and
          ordinance, and its effect, they would be rendered void, as is more
          fully contained in our other letters. Therefore, desiring that our
          will, decree, and aforementioned ordinance be inviolably observed, we
          command your discretion through apostolic writings, that you, either
          both of you, or one of you by yourselves or by another or others,
          wherever and whenever you see fit, solemnly publish the aforementioned
          will, decree, and ordinance by our authority, making it to be observed
          firmly by ecclesiastical censure, and by restraining the contradictors
          with a similar censure, setting aside any appeal. Notwithstanding if
          it has been granted to the same dean and chapter and persons,
          collectively or individually, by the apostolic See, that they cannot
          be interdicted, suspended, or excommunicated by apostolic letters not
          making full and express mention, word for word, of such grant. — Given

          Clement, etc., for future memory of the matter. — The providence of
          the Apostolic See, attentive to circumstances, sometimes modifies and
          regulates them as the quality of affairs and times requires, and it
          discerns expediently in the Lord. Some time ago, it was explained to
          us on behalf of our beloved son, the nobleman Gaufridi, lord of the
          place of Lireyo, in the diocese of Troyes, that recently, on behalf of
          our beloved son Peter, cardinal priest of the title of Saint Susanna,
          it was explained on behalf of the same Gaufridi, that moved by zeal
          for devotion of his father, a certain figure or representation of the
          Shroud of our Lord Jesus Christ had been liberally offered, and had
          been placed with reverence in the church of the Blessed Virgin Mary of
          Lireyo, of the said diocese, of which he himself was the founder. And
          finally, by God's permission, those regions had been severely
          afflicted by wars and pestilences, and the said figure or
          representation, even by the order of the local ordinary and for other
          certain causes, had been transferred from the said church of the
          Blessed Virgin Mary to another more secure place and had been hidden
          there until then, and had been reverently kept; and that the same
          Gaufridus desired for the decoration of the aforementioned church, the
          devotion of the people, and the increase of divine worship, that the
          aforementioned figure or representation be restored in the said
          church, the same cardinal, whom we had then appointed for certain of
          our and the affairs of the said Roman church, to our beloved son in
          Christ, Charles, the illustrious king of the Franks, and who during
          the prosecution of such affairs, was empowered to do, manage, and
          exercise within the cities, dioceses, and provinces through which he
          traveled to and fro and resided, whatever might be done, managed, and
          exercised by the office of the legation of the Roman church cardinal
          within the limits of his legation, and who had passed through the
          province of Sens, from which the said diocese of Troyes exists, had
          granted to the same Gaufridus, during the prosecution of such affairs,
          the power to place and cause the said figure or representation to be
          placed in a fitting, honorable, and decent place in the said church of
          Saint Mary, without seeking or obtaining the permission of the
          diocesan or any other, through his letters; and that the said figure
          or representation, by the force of such indulgence, had been decently
          placed in the said church of the Blessed Mary; and that afterwards,
          our venerable brother Peter, bishop of Troyes, moved by the
          aforementioned indulgence, in his latest synod, had prohibited rectors
          of parish churches and those whom it might concern to make any
          mention, either in good or in evil, of the Shroud of Jesus Christ, or
          its figure or representation in their churches or sermons; and
          finally, our beloved son, the dean of the said church of the Blessed
          Mary, had been inhibited from showing or exhibiting the said figure or
          representation to anyone under penalty of excommunication; and that
          indeed, by virtue of this inhibition, an appeal had been made to the
          same dean to the apostolic See, and because the said figure or
          representation, after such appeal, had been exhibited and shown to the
          public, we confirmed the aforementioned indulgence from certain
          knowledge by apostolic authority; and nevertheless, we granted to the
          same dean and our beloved sons of the chapter of the said church of
          the Blessed Mary, that notwithstanding this inhibition, they could
          validly show and cause to be shown the same figure or representation
          to the public, whenever it would be opportune, imposing perpetual
          silence on the same bishop concerning the aforementioned inhibition,
          as is more fully contained in our letters made on this subject.
          Therefore, seeking to provide for the manner of such display, to
          remove all matter of error and idolatry, we wish and by the tenor of
          these presents, by apostolic authority, we decree and also ordain that
          whenever the said figure or representation henceforth happens to be
          shown to the public, the dean and chapter of the aforementioned, and
          other ecclesiastical persons showing such figure or representation,
          and being present at such display, for as long as the display itself
          lasts, shall by no means wear capes, surplices, albs, copes, or any
          other ecclesiastical vestments or ornaments for that reason, nor shall
          they perform any other solemnities which are accustomed to be done in
          displaying relics, and that therefore neither twisted candles,
          torches, nor candles shall be lit, nor shall any lights whatsoever be
          used there, and that the one showing the said figure, whenever a large
          multitude of people gathered there, shall publicly address and say to
          the people in a clear and intelligible voice, with all fraud ceasing,
          that the aforementioned figure or representation is not the true
          Shroud of our Lord Jesus Christ, but rather a certain painting or
          picture made in the likeness or representation of the Shroud, which is
          said to be of the same Lord Jesus Christ of ours. We decree that if
          they do not observe our said letters and their effect, we judge them
          to be rendered void. Therefore, let no one, etc., infringe upon this
          page of our will, statute, ordinance, and constitution, etc. — Given

          The same is repeated in a second letter sent that day but with the

            representation of the Shroud, which is said to be of the same Our
            Lord Jesus Christ.</em
          >" In the Vatican copy, however, the words painting or picture were
          crossed out on May 30, the same year, by John of Napoli. Most likely
          to make the copy stored in the archive more like the letter sent out
          the same day. As labeled in Chevalier, the
          <em>letter J (K)</em>
          lacks the reference to this being a painting, while the
          <em>Letter K (N)</em>
          has. This change is not reflected in the copy stored in the National
          Library in Paris. Some Sindonologists claim that this change shows
          that this shroud must be the natural burial cloth of Jesus. Somehow
          ignoring that the Pope stated that this is not the Shroud of Jesus,
          but a representation. Maybe the change was implemented to keep a
          single narrative, that they accidentally give d'Arcis right in that
          the shroud was just a painting that could have been used against them.
          Or they wanted to ensure there was enough ambiguity about the shroud
          when the church containing the Turin Shroud was given the right to
          sell indulgences in June. This later part is some speculation on my
          side; we know that there are some differences in the letters and that,
          for some reason, they struck three words a few months later.
        </p>
        <p>
          A reasonably easy question that d'Arcis asks from the start but never
          answers is how de Charny got the cloth. Looking at the letters and
          accounts we have, this has never been answered. Something that would
          be pretty easy to do if Geoffrey de Charny, the elder, got the shroud
          during the Crusades. One might then ask why the shroud was not used as
          Peter Bartholomew's Holy Lance in Antioch. Maybe de Charny wanted to
          keep it to himself for later, but would not this be used to prove the
          authenticity? Or if it was acquired through trade, where, and when.
          These are not hard questions to even make up an answer to. But still,
          it just appeared one day in 1350.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I do have to give d'Arcis that he was tenacious. He really did his
          best to prove his case that the Shroud of Turin was fake and a
          forgery. If it would not have been that the Pope was related to de
          Charny or that the King had not invited de Charny as part of his
          entourage. Who knows what the investigation would have turned up.
          Maybe we would even know the name of the artist who created the
          shroud. Unfortunately, if history tells us something, you can get away
          with anything with the right connections.
        </p>
        <h2 id="turin">Out from Lirey into the fire</h2>
        <p>
          A burning question that we might not have answered yet is how on earth
          the Turin Shroud ended up in Italy. This was done with the help of
          Geoffrey II de Charny's daughter, Margaret de Charny. With her
          husband, Humbert de Villersexel, they took the shroud from the abbey
          for "safe keeping," as they put it. Humbert even promised it would be
          returned to the church when the hostilities from the Hundred Years
          War, which lasted 116 years, were over. Margeret never gave it back
          and instead sold it to Louis I of Savoy. While some claim this was a
          gift, Margeret got the sum of two castles for it, as Nickells points
          out.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This stunt did not impress the church where the Turin Shroud was
          initially housed. Having the relic removed from the church had
          affected their income from pilgrims and the sale of indulgences. The
          Canon, a title for one part of the ecclesiastic rule, demanded the
          Turin Shroud to be returned to them, or Margeret would face
          excommunication. After several warnings, an official excommunication
          was issued on May 30, 1457. Margeret answered that a compensation of
          800 gold ducats would be issued to the church in Lirey. Trying to
          convert ducats to modern value is tricky since it's hard to factor in
          the spending power of the time. I'll put it like this: toward the end
          of his life, Leonardo Da Vinci was paid 400 ducats a year by the
          French King. To Leonardo, one ducat would have been pocket money, but
          it would have been a 10-day pay for one of his apprentices.
        </p>
        <p>
          The month came and went, but no gold, silver, or even a piece of
          copper was sent to the church in Lirey. So, on January 19, 1458,
          Margeret was called in front of the Provost, a rank similar to that of
          a bishop of Troyes. She did not show up for this hearing but was
          defended by her half-brother, Charles de Noyers. He promised that the
          800 ducats would be paid, with an additional 300 for the church's
          legal fees. For this, the church pledged to lift the excommunication
          temporarily, and if the fine was paid by October 1458, it would be
          suspended. October came and went with no money sent to the church.
          Margret would die in 1460.
        </p>
        <p>
          The canons in Lirey had not given up, however, and now went after the
          house of Savoy. They did not have much luck retrieving the cloth back,
          but Duke Louise offered a small yearly token amount to be paid to the
          church. A sum that was paid until Louise's death; his descendants
          would not continue to pay this token amount. At this point, the clergy
          went to the King of France. Unfortunately, we don't know the outcome
          of this complaint. We can tell that the shroud was left in Savoy
          Chapel and that the wooden church in Lirey had gone into disrepair and
          would not soon be abandoned. Some who want to give Margeret a good
          reason for keeping the cloth try to argue that she did not give the
          cloth back due to the state of the church. However, this argument
          doesn't really work from a historical perspective since the church did
          not deteriorate until the money source dried up.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the Shroud of Turin was kept in Savoy's possession in the Savoy
          Chapel. But since it's not known as the shroud of Savoy, there is
          still a small part left of the story. In 1471, Amadeus IX of Savoy
          petitioned Pope Sixtus IV to be able to build a sanctuary for the
          shroud. The wish was granted, and in 1502, it was finished. In 1506,
          after petitioning Pope Julius II, the church was named the Sainte
          Chapelle of the Holy Shroud. With this, a special feast was instituted
          for the shroud. With this new honor, droves of pilgrims started to
          arrive at the chapel. Everything was well and good until 1532. On
          December 4th, a fire would spread through the chapel. Two Franciscan
          monks were able to save the shroud by the skin of their teeth. With a
          feat like that, one would think someone would have bothered to name
          these monks, but no. Unfortunately, molted silver had dripped on the
          edges of the folded shroud, making large holes that you are most
          likely familiar with.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1535, the shroud would go on a tour and be displayed at a handful
          of places in Italy and France. Turin would later be the final resting
          spot due in part to a political act to move the Savoy capital. Except
          for a brief period during World War II the shroud would not leave
          Turin again. At this point, it was rumored to have extraordinary
          powers, and the proclaims of Clement VII were long forgotten.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the known history from the cloth beginning to becoming the
          shroud of Turin.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to wrap it all up, we've traversed a landscape dotted with twists
          and turns. From the start, there seem to have been questions regarding
          the authenticity of the shroud of Turin. It's intriguing to ponder the
          what-ifs. What if Pope Clement VII had green-lighted an exhaustive
          investigation? What if the artist, assuming there was one, had been
          given credit for what could arguably be the greatest art hoax of the
          millennium?
        </p>
        <p>
          But from the information we have so far, the evidence leans more
          toward fabrication. The sudden appearance and the focus on money for
          most of its history are usually telltale signs that this is a hoax.
          Not necessarily with intent from de Charny; they could have bought it
          from someone else and might have been fooled. Yet, if they had
          purchased it, why not disclose this when those questions were asked?
          Why was the origin kept secret from the get-go?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, there are many what-ifs, but is there any hard scientific
          evidence? Some say yes, others say no. So, in the next episode, we
          will go through the scientific evidence claimed to exist around the
          shroud of Turin.
