          In this episode of Digging Up Ancient Aliens, the host, Fredrik,
          revisits Gunung Padang, a site in Indonesia that has become known due
          to a study and a pseudo-documentary on Netflix.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We compare Ancient Aliens narratives and Graham Hancock's Atlantis
          Hyperdiffusion Theory. The then-sitting government initiated the
          excavation project at Gunung Padang in 2011 as part of a strategy to
          redefine nationalistic ideas and create a new national monument
          founded on an imagined advanced civilization.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, both Ancient Aliens, Graham Hancock, and other Atlantis believers
          claim that the site reveals a 300-foot-tall step pyramid dating back
          at least 10,000 years. We will spend this episode looking at the hard
          evidence, the funding, and the reality of the claims, both from
          Ancient Aliens, Graham Hancock, Danny Hilman Natawidjaja, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          It will be an information-packed episode where we will discover how
          pseudoscience actively defunds vulcano monitoring programs. How
          Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis has been disproven and how to not do
          your C14 dating. We also spent time among the Toraja people in
          Indonesia and learned about their culture. And what on Earth does
          Megan Fox have to do with any of this?

          Hi, hello, and v√§lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the
          podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history and
          ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 54, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we return to Gunung Padang, a site
          that we visited some time before but have not revisited since the
          infamous paper was released in late 2023. A few months have passed,
          and maybe it's time to review the subject. Since we're still doing the
          Ancient Alien Top Ten Pyramids, we also have the opportunity to
          compare the Ancient Alien Theory with the Atlantis Hyperdiffusion
          Theory. It's not often we have the chance to compare two alternative
          history narratives side by side like this. Also, what does Megan Fox
          have to do with any of this? While you sit on the edge of your seat,
          it might be time to start.

          A megalithic thank you to all the patrons and members, like Phillip,
          who support this show. The Patreon bonus episode should have dropped
          by now, focusing on "Chariots of the Gods" by Van D√§niken. If you want
          to learn how to support the show, I'll tell you all about that later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="gungung">Gunung Padang</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Indonesia and a site we have visited before, Gunung Padang.
          It is a site that has recently become known due to a study and a
          pseudo-documentary on Netflix. Of course, I talk about Ancient
          Apocalypse. We investigated a series in four episodes; if you have
          missed them, they are episodes 30 to 33. So, this allows us to compare
          the narratives between Ancient Aliens and Graham Hancock. While
          Hancock has been in the past a frequent guest on Ancient Aliens, he
          has since focused on promoting his white culture bearers from Atlantis
          and promoting a more esoteric version of alien intervention. Graham
          isn't ruling out alien communication; it's just in a more spiritual
          connection.
        </p>
        <p>Let's see how Ancient Aliens set the tone for Gunung Padang.</p>
        <p>
          "Western Java, Indonesia. 2013. The Indonesian government sponsors an
          excavation to explore what might be hidden beneath the layers of dirt
          and rubble at a site known as Gunung Padang, or "Mountain of Light."
          They uncover incredible evidence revealing a 300-foot-tall step
          pyramid dating back at least 10,000 years."
        </p>
        <p>
          They base most of the segment on what Graham Hancock wrote in the 2015
          book "Magicians of the Gods." How I came to know this is due to the
          use of the translation Mountain of Light. So far, I've only seen
          Hancock translating the hill's name this way. In the book and in
          Ancient Apocalypse, Graham claims that "Gunung Padang, the name it
          still goes by today, often mistranslated as "Mountain Field" by those
          unaware that the language of this area is not Indonesian but
          Sundanese‚Äîin which Gunung Padang means "Mountain of Light," or
          "Mountain of Enlightenment."" The issue with this statement is that
          it's simply not true. While enlightenment can be a bit more complex to
          translate as it carries a deep philosophical or spiritual connotation.
          A close translation might be "pencerahan," which conveys the sense of
          illumination or enlightenment in an intellectual or spiritual sense.
          As for light, we get "cahayaan," and I don't find any synonyms that
          are even similar to Padang. The closest meaning I can see is field.
          This is corroborated by a Sundanese translator and available
          dictionaries. While it's a petty thing to linger on, this is not
          really a home run for either Ancient Aliens or Graham Hancock.
        </p>
        <h2 id="money">Follow the money</h2>
        <p>
          While Hancock does not bring up the fact that a nationalistic
          government sponsored this excavation in his pseudo-documentary, it's
          interesting that Ancient Aliens did. Back in 2019, the Ancient Alien
          show claimed the excavations started in 2011, which is closer to the
          truth than other narratives. However, Graham Hancock discusses how the
          excavation was funded and approved in the book "Magicians of the
          Gods." But the narrative there is also slightly off compared to the
          actual timeline. The excavation project started in 2011, initiated by
          the then-sitting government. The investigating group was called The
          Integrated and Independent Research Team, or TTRM, and was led by Andi
          Arief, Special Staff to the President. This is a sort of advisory
          position within the Indonesian government and is supposed to give
          targeted and specific advice on different issues.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, from the start, this project started on the orders of the current
          government. As Sulistyowati and Foe point out in a paper, this was
          part of a strategy to redefine nationalistic ideas and create a new
          national monument founded on a previously advanced civilization. We
          saw a similar concept in Bosnia, for example. On top of having
          government involvement from the start, it might be good to mention
          that they also had Ali Akbar, Deputy Chair of the National Team for
          Archaeology. All of this makes Hancock's claim in the book that this
          project was in danger of being suppressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When I ask what he means by obstacles he replies that some senior
          Indonesian archaeologists are lobbying the government in Jakarta to
          prevent him from doing any further work at Gunung Padang on the
          grounds that they "know" the site is less than three thousand years
          old and see no justification for disturbing it."
        </p>
        <p>
          The protest was, of course, voiced from the start since the project,
          from its conception, was not based on a scientific idea. It was based
          on proving a pseudoscientific claim that the site was part of an
          ancient super-civilization. Some within the Indonesian government did
          question this excavation back in early 2013, as pointed out by Prasdi:
          "/.../ three departments: the Department of Education and Culture, the
          Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education, and the
          Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, which state that there are
          no indications of any structures within Mount Padang, were met with
          accusations that these three ministries manipulated research reports
          on the Mount Padang site."
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have three independent reports from three government bodies, in
          combination with archeologists, geologists, and vulcanologists,
          explaining that what we see at Gungung Padang isn't extraordinary.
          Associate professor of Geology Callan Bentley has a great article that
          simply explains how columns are formed by cooling fronts. That the
          columns make astonishing patterns that some might interpret as
          human-made isn't strange. I mean, go out in archaeological field
          school excavations with students who have never excavated. You will
          hear "I found something" every second a nice rock is found. I've been
          there, and when you look for patterns, your brain will help you
          connect things, even if they are not there. But the columnar joints
          found in the position they are on top of an old volcano are not really
          strange or surprising.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But after Andi Arief dismissed the reports from the ministries, he
          confirmed the excavations would continue and be expanded in 2013. The
          early part of the project and excavations are documented by Ali Akbar
          in a book published in 2013 and an unpublished article from Danny
          Natawidjaja in 2014. The later report also included images from the
          excavation that confirm that the project was excavating at this stage
          and was of a pretty decent size. The funding at this stage has not
          really been disclosed so far. However, since the project was part of a
          government task force, I can assume it was not insignificant with the
          workforce and equipment we see.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, in 2014, the project was granted a blank check. This was on
          order from the President, a decision Hancock in "Magicians of the
          Gods" paints as something positive. I guess he left his "follow the
          money journalism" days back in the 1980s. The book claims that the
          excavation started in 2014, which is wrong, as we have seen. It's not
          great when you are out journalisted by an archaeologist. At the start
          of the second part of the project, Natawidjaja and the TTRM received
          some 250,000 dollars, and it's unclear how much they received in
          total. Of course, this came at a cost to other real archaeological
          sites and even geological surveys and monitoring of volcanoes in
          Indonesia. When the Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation
          Center (PVMBG) is underfunded while a group digging up an old vulcano
          looking for Atlantis has unlimited funds, something has gone horribly
          wrong.
        </p>
        <h2 id="paper">Gunung Padang Paper</h2>
        <p>
          While on the subject, I assume we have to talk a little about the
          recently published paper about the site. "Geo-archaeological
          prospecting of Gunung Padang buried prehistoric pyramid in West Java,
          Indonesia," was published in October 2023 and received much
          unfortunate media attention. Some good news regarding the paper is
          that the journal has started investigating it. Unfortunately, it's a
          tad late. The data within, however, might be even more disappointing
          because it's the same data and conclusion I debunked last spring. It's
          the same data that Rebecka Bradley could disprove in 2017 and the
          exact C14 dates Carl Faegan questioned in August of the previous
          year.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Natawidjaja had put these samples on a poster for a conference back in
          2017. That seven years of excavations and research with unlimited
          funds only resulted in 13 C14 samples, many of which came from core
          samples, is strange. Even worse is that all samples are from unknown
          organic material. No material culture at the site supports these old
          dates, but it hasn't stopped the team from randomly dating cultural
          layers. When using C14 to date something, we need to know what it was
          and what it was a part of. When employing carbon-14 (C14) dating, it's
          crucial to understand not just what we're dating but also its
          historical context. This is especially true for organic materials,
          which can naturally relocate without human involvement. Simply
          determining the age of an object tells us only when it ceased being
          part of a living entity. For instance, uncovering wooden planks in an
          archaeological dig within a town might suggest remnants of a
          building's flooring or a nearby pathway. However, finding a stray
          piece of wood or charcoal in a test pit in an open field doesn't
          necessarily indicate human activity. Such samples could originate from
          natural events like forest fires or fragments of fallen branches.
          Understanding the context is critical in distinguishing between
          artifacts of human life and mere natural occurrences.

          So, this paper fails to support the author's conclusion that this is a
          20,000-year-old pyramid. Reading the paper, it becomes evident that
          they are not using the scientific process. They started the whole
          project with the conclusion that Gunung Padang is an ancient pyramid
          built over 10,000 years ago. Again, this is something you'll notice if
          reading Natawidjaja's 2013 book "Plato Never Lied: Atlantis Is In
          Indonesia" or Ali Akbar's books. All predate the "official" excavation
          and were written during the TTRM project's early stages. The team is
          not looking at the site from a neutral perspective but trying to find
          evidence for their conclusion no matter what. For example, a ¬Ω Cent
          from the Netherlands East Indies, minted somewhere between 1914 and
          1949, became a 5,200-year-old amulet. How they came to this conclusion
          is unclear, especially since it was found in a layer they claim was
          dated to 10,000 BCE.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while media, Natawidjaja, Graham Hancock, and others have
          celebrated this paper as evidence of a lost Atlantean civilization.
          They do this solely based on confirmation bias. As we see, this has
          not been a scientific endeavor. And the carbon 14 dates are, as Carl
          Faegan and Rebecka Bradley point out, things we would expect dating an
          organic sequence in a volcano. As I discussed in episode 31, the
          mountain is not challenging for a vulcanologist or geologist with
          similar expertise to explain. Natawidjaja, Akbar, and Hancock have yet
          to explain how the site can't be a volcano.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          After the break, we will look at the Younger Dryas Hypothesis. Does it
          hold up to scientific scrutiny, or is it just wishful thinking from
          its proponents?
        </p>
        <h2 id="YDIH">Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis - busted!</h2>
        <p>
          When we compare the narratives between the Atlantean and alien camps,
          things get even more mesmerizing. We have a weird situation where they
          twist the narrative slightly from the other pseudo-historians. While
          we are used to this as something done to scientists, we haven't seen
          them do this to themself in the past.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "According to geologists, 20,000 years ago, this area of Java was not
          an isolated island, but the southernmost part of a subcontinent known
          as Sundaland. This has led some researchers to speculate that Gunung
          Padang, with its high elevation, could have been at the pinnacle of a
          civilization that disappeared sometime around 10,000 BC, when melting
          ice caps flooded the region and turned it into the series of islands
          it is today. But if true, just who was this mysterious culture capable
          of building a 300-foot-tall pyramid?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of this resembles the narrative we heard in places like the
          Ancient Apocalypse. Large parts of this section build on a previous
          episode from the season 13. The flood myths are not as driving in the
          ancient Astronaut idea compared to the Atlantean Hyperdiffusion
          Theory, they are still a component in the larger Ancient Alien
          mythology. But then it's not due to a natural disaster or act of
          nature but a deliberate plan from the alien overlords to cull the
          human population. In 2019, they had Megan Fox (yes that Megan Fox),
          who discussed the connection between aliens and the Younger Dryas
          Impact speculation. Then we also have Praveen Mohan, an Ancient Alien
          proponent, who will speak at the cosmic summit. I think we can start
          to expect that there will be a closer connection between the AHT and
          AA narratives going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the Younger Dryas Impact hypothesis, as it's often known among
          its proponents, this idea has been reasonably disproved. For a deeper
          understanding of this, I'd recommend going through the paper
          "Comprehensive refutation of the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis."
          It's written by Vance Holliday and others, including Mark Boslough,
          who is a frequent poster in the "Fraudulent Archaeology Wall of Shame"
          group on Facebook. I'll give you a short version of why the YDI hoax
          is problematic.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, it seems like some people are attempting to find solutions to
          problems that may not require any solutions at all. The fact that a
          cooling period coincides with the conclusion of an archaeological era
          does not necessarily imply a connection between the two. There could
          be other causes for the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT)
          and the end of Clovis that are not related to a natural global
          disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we see flawed evidence supporting their idea. Dates for
          suggested YDIH sites lack proper dating, and those who have dated have
          been criticized for methods prone to errors. Also, purported impact
          indicators are questioned for their association with impacts and
          conflicting scenarios, and those few sites with accurate dating don‚Äôt
          show high levels of these indicators. They have also been unable to
          truly rule out natural, non-impact explanations for several of the
          features they claim to support this idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we lack terrestrial consequences; we don't see the effects in the
          records for an event of this magnitude so close in time. They also
          fail to meet standard scientific criteria and others in academia, and
          Holliday et al. have raised several concerns about inaccuracies within
          these studies. In a nutshell, YDIH has significant problems, including
          weak evidence and methodological issues. As I mentioned, if you want a
          deeper understanding of these issues with the Younger Dryas Impact
          Hypothesis, I recommend reading through this study.
        </p>
        <h2 id="myth">Misuse of mythology</h2>
        <p>
          So, if Ancient Aliens are not suggesting that Gunung Padang was built
          by Atlanteans to warn us about an impending meteor strike. What are
          they suggesting then?
        </p>
        <p>
          "In Indonesian star lore, there's a constellation of particular
          interest. They call it Vendum Viduk. We call Ursa Major. It is thought
          that it is the shape of a boat, and that the original craft, the
          original starship carrying the people came from this place to their
          land. Their houses, the long houses, the community structures are
          built in the shape of a boat, always facing northward in honor of the
          place of their origins. These star travelers are said to have started
          the original royal family. The name of the people, Toraja, means
          "those who come from the stars.""
        </p>
        <p>
          So what we get is the classic Ancient Alien trope that local myths
          that incorporate gods or the sky mean they had alien contact. Here, we
          see something Ancient Aliens and the Atlantean hyperdiffusion
          proponents have in common. Cultural dismissal. Both camps imply that
          ancient people of our past could not have imagination or symbolic
          thought. This approach to myth really minimizes the creativity of
          ancient people. They also dismiss this way that these myths can
          contain a rich symbolic and metaphorical layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach to myth also ignores humanity's skyward wonder. We, as a
          species, have, since the dawn of time, been fascinated with the sky
          and celestial bodies. One could almost say this is part of the human
          experience because it is not unique to any particular culture,
          location, or period. That our ancestors attributed divine qualities to
          phenomena in the sky is not strange. It's part of the human tendency
          to mythologize the unknown; we, as a species, don't really do well
          with things we don't understand. Attributing the divine properties
          this way becomes a way to explain and relate to the world they lived
          in. This doesn't necessarily have to indicate alien contact or
          Atlantean culture bearers. Reducing complex mythologies to simple
          explanations like the aliens did it or white guys from Atlantis did it
          ignores the depth and diversity of these stories. Myths are rarely
          meant to explain one thing. They often include several different
          aspects, including morals, explanations for natural phenomena, and a
          recording of historical events in a nonliteral sense. So reducing
          these myth to mere desriptions of alien or atlantean encounters truely
          dissmiss the myths educational, psychological and educational value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we have the issue that they mix mythology and language. Vendum
          Vidak is not a word or a term I can locate in the Toraja language or
          any academic text avalible in different databases. Not even Jimbob's
          alien blog mentions Vendum Vidak. The only other occurrence is in the
          transcripts of two Ancient Alien episodes. In Javanese, however, the
          constellation is known as the "lintang jong" or the boat
          constellation. There is no doubt that the constellation is essential
          in the Toraja society. Ursa Major is vital in the funerary rites. As
          Hetty Noovy Palm puts it, "The soul then takes his (or her) place in
          either Ursa Major or the Pleiades, star clusters of importance in rice
          cultivation. Rice is considered as more or less under their
          protection."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We can learn this from the Toraja verse "Chant for the Deceased." In
          van der Veen's 1966 translation, section 1B, verse 125, it reads:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Manda' natakia' Lemba, nasalulgku buga'lalan, naapun megkidi-kidi."
          Translated, this means, "The Great Bear holds him in its arms, The
          Pleiades clasp him to them, The shining stars encompass him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Note the absence of Vendum Vidak in this verse. Here, 'Lemba' seems to
          refer to the Ursa Major constellation. Referencing Noovy Palms's
          analysis of the text, we find the signs pertain to the rice
          agricultural season. 'Bunga'lalan' is connected to the Pleiades; its
          literal meaning is 'the one who prepares the way' or 'the opener.'
          This constellation appears at the start of the rice cultivation
          season, leading the Toraja to conduct a ritual that marks the
          beginning of the planting season. Palm further explains the
          significance of this sign, noting that it symbolizes the ancestors
          watching over their descendants. Since this is the place where the
          soul goes to the afterlife if of course the proper rituals are
          conducted before burial. This way, descendants pray to the ancestors,
          hoping for their assistance in the afterlife to ensure a bountiful
          harvest.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the break, we will look closer at the Toraja people and their
          houses and see if the Ancient Aliens might have been involved. But as
          we have seen so far, their real history is far more interesting.
        </p>
        <h2 id="toraja">The Toraja people</h2>
        <p>
          There is a mistranslation of the meaning of the name "Toraja." It is
          often believed to mean "those who come from the stars," but this is
          not entirely accurate. While the Indonesian word "raja" does mean
          "king" or "prince," you only get to the "star people" origin if you
          combine the translation with the myth about gods descending from the
          sky. However, this translation does not accurately reflect the native
          meaning of the word. A more accurate translation of "Toraja" using
          this approach would be "Land of Heavenly Kings."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if we look more closely at the word "Toraja," we can see that
          it is made up two words. "To" and "Raja." According to Noovy Palms, a
          closer translation would be "people of high status," "people whom
          others esteem," or "whom others deem worthy." This translation,
          however, is not based on the Taraja people's language. If we look at
          the name through their eyes, it comes from "to ri aja," which
          translates to "people of the uplands." This is similar to the phrase
          "to luu'," which translates to "people of the sea," and provides
          insight into the Taraja people's relationship with their environment.
        </p>
        <h2 id="tongkonan">Tongkonan&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          The Toraja mythology is deep and complex. As usual, sources and
          information can be found on the episode page if you want to learn
          more. Before moving on, however, I want to touch on the Tongkonan
          houses. Or, as the quote put it, to boat-shaped houses. They are
          clearly boat-shaped, but this is not to imitate a spaceship, as we
          heard here. Again, this is a clear example of how Ancient Alien theory
          is reductionist toward indigenous mythology. Waterson writes about the
          Taraja: "Here too we find a richly imaginative body of stories in
          which myth, genealogy and history are woven together, always bound up
          with landscape and the house." It's not wrong to view the Tongkonan as
          a "place of remembrence." A place that's deeply connected to the
          family, history, and genealogy. So, the Tongkonan is not just a house
          where you live. It's a fundamental spot for family gatherings and
          community events, including social and religious gatherings. The name
          Tongkonan comes from the verb tongkon, meaning "to sit," again
          highlighting the house's role as a gathering place.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Each of the Tongkonans represents one family, and they come in
          different sizes, and each one carries an individual name. As some name
          their cars, the Taraja name their house. These houses are essential to
          upkeep, and a ricefield and a palm grove are often connected with the
          house to support repairs and feasts. Something I found interesting is
          that the houses are inherited through the maternal lineage. When a
          couple marries, the man moves to the woman. In case of a divorce, the
          man is not allowed to take things from the Tongkonan or take over the
          house. What the former husband can take, however, to start new is the
          rice silo structure that stands out back. When a child is born, the
          placenta is also buried on the western side of the house, again
          anchoring it with the maternal side.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The house itself is supposed to be modeled after the god Puang Matua's
          construction. At first, Puang Matua built a simple house, just as the
          first people lived in, up in the sky. This simple hut was described to
          have four poles carrying up the roof and was referred to as the navel
          of the house. But then he evolved to building a house with iron
          pillars that would never decay in the center of the house. While it
          might be tempting to connect iron and sky with aliens, we are that
          way, forgetting all the other stuff associated with the legend.
          Remember that the Tongkonan is inherited through generations; it's not
          supposed to be temporary; it's eternal. Describing Puang Matua house
          as having iron pillars is not an attempt to depict a spaceship since
          the rest of the Tongkonans are made of wood. It's more to reinforce
          the eternity of the family in that sense.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Toraja built the houses to stand north to south, this can be
          connected to the mythological worldview. But it's also worth
          mentioning that Puang Matua made his house stand east to west,
          following the sun's path. But in the Toraja culture, it's "pemali" or
          forbidden to construct your Tongkonan in this direction on Earth.
          Again, this simplifies mythology to a point where you lose large parts
          that explain the context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we have the last nail in the coffin. Toraja's land is on
          Sulawesi Island, and Gunung Padang is on Java, close to the city of
          Jakarta. There are some 1300 kilometers between these two islands, and
          it's hard to really understand how they connected the Toraja people
          with Gunung Padang. If you didn't want to accuse the Ancient Alien
          people of cherry-picking before, maybe this is the time.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="whatisgunung">What is Gunung Padang?</h2>
        <p>
          So if Gunung Padang is not the world's largest and oldest pyramid and
          built either by white Atlanteans or aliens, what is it then? The
          earliest known account of the site and its enclosure can be traced
          back to an account by Rogier Veerbek from 1891. Later, it can also be
          found in a report by Dutch archaeologist Nicolaas Johannes Krom in
          1915. Krom described the site as a place with four enclosures with a
          funerary function. Worth mentioning is that since then, no burials
          have been found at the site.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have become almost forgotten had it not been for three locals
          rediscovering the site in 1979. The enclosures we see at the site are
          believed to be a 'Punden Berundak' ‚Äì a term from the local language
          translating to 'Glorified person.' These megalithic structures,
          scattered across West Java, resemble step pyramids with layered
          platforms, each level a stage for ancestral worship.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tradition of building Punden Berundak flourished during the
          Paleometallic Period, a time frame stretching from 500 BCE to 500 CE,
          marking the Indo-Malayan Bronze-Iron Age. Gunung Padang isn't just
          another structure in this tradition; it's unique. It incorporates a
          natural 885-meter-tall hill, making it the largest of its kind. Other
          examples, like Lebak Sibedug and Arca Domas, share their architectural
          DNA but not their grandeur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, this architectural style echoes the later Samoan
          traditions of mound building around 1100 CE. This connection, while
          distant, hints at a broader cultural exchange across the region.
          However, before diving deeper into these connections, it's important
          to note that Punden Berundak's theory is intertwined with regional
          pride and identity. I again like to stress that the hill is just an
          old volcano since long in deep slumber. The constructors of the site
          certainly took advantage of the tall hill and the resources that could
          be found on top of it. Why work harder when you can work smarter. But
          that's it. From the archaeological evidence, this is the explanation
          that fits based on decades of excavations, including whatever
          Natawidjaja and his emergency group did. We should always look at the
          evidence and then make a conclusion, not try to fit our evidence into
          our predetermined narrative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next time, we will end our Ancient Aliens Top Ten Pyramids series. If
          you have followed this exploration from the start, you know this was
          number three on the list. Number two is the temple of Borobudur, also
          here in Indonesia. I will skip it since the argument boils down to
          "Buddha is depicted as sitting inside these small stupas. But it looks
          like Buddha is flying a flying saucer at Borobudur." Sometimes, we
          need to choose our battles, and we will have time to return to this
          claim in a later episode since this is based on a compilation
          episode.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Next time we meet, it's time to learn what pyramid occupies the number
          one spot on this list. I hope to see you then.

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.
