          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 28. Since it's almost
          Christmas, it might be nice to look into different rituals and how
          they might be evidence of Alien visitation. We will start in
          Mesoamerica and investigate human sacrifices, then go to the UK and
          the Stone of Destiny. Is the tradition of monarchy and regalia really
          an invention by aliens? We also learn about the Bep Kororoti and how
          Egyptian and Viking ships try to emulate spaceships.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I get too far into this episode, I want to highlight something
          listener Stella sent in. In our previous episode, I said that Orion's
          belt would be foreign and unimportant in Mayan society. Well, it turns
          out I was wrong. The name was, of course, not used, but in some
          creation myths, the belt is important. This is due to the Mayan hearth
          in their house having three stones. So it was believed that the god's
          home also would have three stones. We will get into more creation
          stories in this episode and see more versions of this. The episode
          notes have been updated, and a huge thank you to Stella!

        <h2 id="sacrifice">Mayans Blood sacrifice</h2>
        <p>
          We start again with a trip to the Mayans, maybe to show the Mayan idea
          of cyclical time. The show will focus on two things in this part.
          Human sacrifice and El Castillo (Kukulk&aacute;n) at Chichen Itza in
          the Yucutan. The reasons, I believe, are more due to these two things
          being more known and drawing in the viewers in a sense. Most of us
          react with a sort of horror fascination when we hear the word
          &ldquo;human sacrifice,&rdquo; and the show makes us of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          There&rsquo;s no great reason for the show to bring up this
          phenomenon; the connection to aliens is vague and more of an
          afterthought. William Bramley describes the sacrifice as.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >They would bring their human victims up the stairs of their temple,
            they would cut up their being hearts, and that would be the form of
            sacrifice the Mayans engaged in.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>&ndash; William Bramley (Author, The Gods of Eden)</p>
        <p>
          Now it's a gruesome act that they are describing here and one that I'm
          sure you're familiar with, and we'll look into the Mayan religion here
          and human sacrifice a little bit. As you might suspect, the show claim
          that the gods worshiped among the Mayans were not gods. They were
          aliens, coming to earth and giving the Mayan the idea of civilization.
          Now let's look into a bit of the religion and spiritual beliefs and
          then compare what we have learned to what the show claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we should acknowledge that Mayan religion and spirituality were
          severely traumatized by the Spanish Conquest. What we know today is a
          reconstruction of the bits and pieces that survived the destruction
          and attempts at annihilation by the Europeans and the Catholic
          Church.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on, we see a couple of ideas that might seem strange to us. For
          once, all living things have something called "k'uh," an invisible
          sacred quality. The gods could have either animalistic or humanoid
          looks. But at the same time, they could have actual forms you could
          see as the sun, moon, venus, or rain. But they could also take an
          auditory form, such as thunder. We also have the idea of an invisible
          companion; it was not only us mere mortals who had these spirit
          companions. No, even the gods had one assigned to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, for example, we can look at God G or Kinich Ahau. Why did I call
          this God G? As we briefly discussed in the last episode, the Mayan
          hieroglyphs were decoded relatively late. So when scholars tried to
          examine the early codices (a sort of book), they had a problem. They
          could not read the texts, but from the context, they could see that
          gods were represented in the document. Paul Schellhas set up a system
          where each representation got a letter between A-P, which has since
          been stuck in the literature. Kinich Ahau is a god well rooted in the
          Classical era and was the sun god. Kinich Ahau could be represented as
          a man, a jaguar, or a deer, but at the same time, be the literal sun.
          While also having a spiritual companion just like everyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the Mayan society, you will learn that they found comfort
          in order. They found this, especially in the sky, through astronomy.
          The stars move in a way that you can expect where they will be at a
          given time. The Mayans called the stars and planets "sky wanderers"
          due to their movements. Note that these bodies were astronomical
          concepts and the literal embodiment of the gods. But to the Mayan
          people, the sky wanderers would not come to earth. It would not make
          sense. These beings had a life; each day they were born, they lived
          throughout the night or day and then death as it set. We will see this
          cyclical idea a bit more later.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We see the kings (or Ajaw) as high priests in this society. Now they
          were not god-kings, but they were the highest-ranking person in the
          religion of the state.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's look into the creation story since we have only brushed upon
          this in earlier episodes. I must warn you, though, there's not one
          creation story in the Mayan religion. There are several, but they
          contain similar elements. The common characteristic is that humans
          were not born into the first world. Remember that the Mayan calendar
          starts at the beginning of the 13th baktun. In most stories, we have
          three worlds before the final one. The people in the northern Yucatan
          believed that the first world was inhabited by dwarfs. But all these
          first attempts had flaws, and the gods had to start over, just as they
          would do with our version at one point. Most of these destructions are
          by floods, but in contrast to the bible, there were no survivors or
          boats. Since there are so many versions, I've decided to use the most
          common telling found in the Popol Vuh.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So in the aftermath of the last destruction, the earth is left as an
          ill-defined mess. Vukub Kaquix, a giant bird, is going around claiming
          to be the lord of both the sun and the moon. The hero-twins kill Vakub
          with a blowgun, and with the birds' death, the sun and the moon can
          rule their rightful domains.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But where did the Hero-Twins come from? To answer this, we have to
          talk about the demise of the maize god Hun Hunapu and his brother
          Vukub Hunapu. These two were terrific ballplayers who unfortunately
          lost a ballgame in Xibalba (the underworld) to the gods of death. The
          name of my deathcore metal band, it's not, but it should be. The
          brother was buried under the Xibalba ball court, while Hun Hunapu's
          severed head was hanged in a Calabash tree. There Hunapu somehow spits
          in the hands of the daughters to the death gods, that way, impregnates
          here. This causes her to flee to the surface, where her mother
          protects her and she births the twins.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          They are taken care of by the grandmother, and someday after they
          killed the monster Vukub Kaquix, they find their fathers' ballgame
          equipment. The Twins are outstanding players and get invited to
          Xibalba to play the gods of death. But it turns out that the gods of
          death don't like to lose, so they try to kill the twins through trials
          during the night. Luckily the animals are on their side and tell the
          Hero-Twins about this. But in the end, the death gods would not let
          them go; to escape, they sacrificed themself. The gods of death burned
          and milled their bones and spread the ashes in the river. From this
          river, the twins were reborn and returned back to Xibalba. This time
          for vengeance!
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of playing the ball game with the gods, they showed them a new
          trick they had learned. One of the twins beheaded the other and then
          resurrected the dead sibling. The gods of death found this trick so
          amusing and fantastic that they demanded the Hero-Twins to perform the
          tick on them. They did, of course, oblige and beheaded the gods. But
          they did not resurrect them. Instead, the twins were transformed into
          the Sun and Venus, forever fated to relive their birth, escape, and
          death for eternity.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is one version, and as I mentioned, there are others out there.
          In some, the hero twins are not turned into celestial bodies. Instead,
          the maize god rises through a spring in the ball court. In other, the
          god Chaak resurrected the Maize god by breaking into Xibalba. The
          Maize god becomes the tree of life, starting the new creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have mentioned ancestral worship in the past, and the dead was a
          big part of Mayan society. Something I find refreshing is that there's
          no idea of hell. Everyone goes to this place of abundance called
          "Flower Mountain," The Spanish react strongly that even people commit
          suicide, die in childbirth, war, or whatever went there. But there
          were two layers of the afterlife, the normal and being a god. The
          Mayan kings were not gods on earth like the Egyptian Pharaoh, but upon
          their death, they became gods. This is why blood sacrifice is
          essential. The king isn't just talking to his ancestors; he is talking
          with the gods through his ancestors. We even have examples of queens
          doing the bloodletting since they might have a particular ancestor in
          their bloodline.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So looking at all we have learned in the past episodes and today, you
          have to shoehorn aliens into the Mayan mythology. Looking at their
          beliefs, there is not much room for aliens. But what we see instead is
          the idea of sacrifices and repetition. Everything was bound to happen
          again. Time was not a line; it was a cycle. What happened in the past
          shall occur in the future. The most important sacrifice was the king's
          blood; his bloodletting rituals ensured the cycle would continue. But
          if you wanted to sacrifice someone, the Mayans preferred a king. They
          were often beheaded as a representation of the Maize god, as we saw
          earlier. But ordinary people would be sacrificed too, their blood was
          a sort of food for the gods but more importantly, it was a celebration
          of the sun's rebirth and life.&nbsp;

          Some early accounts from the Spainyards claim that the Aztecs or other
          Mayan-speaking cultures introduced human sacrifice to the Mayans. But
          looking at Mayan art, this seems to be a later construction from the
          Yucutan Mayan. If, of course, these accounts are even true. As we
          start to note, there's not much room for aliens in their religion or
          human sacrifice. The show's thesis is that they performed these
          sacrifices to try to get their alien gods to come back. But something
          else is needed to fit in with the ideas of the Mayans. The human
          sacrifices were to make sure the gods gave them good favors. That's
          why we see an increase towards the end of the Mayan civilization
          before Spain started to force their culture on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have spent some ten minutes explaining roughly Mayan religion; the
          show spent maybe two minutes on this. This is good to highlight; it's
          easy to make things up without evidence. But it takes a lot of time to
          explain why this is wrong. This is a comprehensive guide to Mayan
          religion and practice, but I hope you, my dear listener, are inspired
          to go and learn more. The show notes will provide excellent resources
          for learning more about this topic.
        </p>
        <h2 id="elcastillo">El Castillo</h2>
        <p>
          But let's move on to where some sacrifices took place, El Castillo, or
          as it was called by the Mayans, Kukulc&aacute;n. As the name
          indicates, it was a temple dedicated to the deity of Kukulc&aacute;n
          or Quetzalcoatl, as the feathered serpent was known in Mexico. The
          show's main focus here is a particular shadow that appears on this
          pyramid on the equinoxes. I'll let Von D&auml;niken explain this to
          us.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"This is a model of the pyramid of Chechen ltza in Mexico. And
            every year, on March 21, when the sun goes up, directly on the
            stairway here is created triangles of light and shadow coming down
            the stairs which represents god Kukulkan has descended to the
            humans. At the end, you see the face of god Kukulkan. On September
            21st, it is the opposite, this time when the sun rises up in the
            morning, god Kukulkan goes up the stairs, and ends in a bright light
            up on the little temple which means god Kukulkan visits the
            earthlings, teaches them and after a certain period, it disappears
            into the sky, with the promise to return one day."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So the idea presented is that since the shadow descends and ascends,
          this must indicate that aliens visited us. We're back to the claim if
          something goes up or down, it might be a civilization explaining an
          encounter of the third kind. But does this really happen as presented?
          Well, the shadow only goes one way, and we're still determining if
          this was intended or a happy coincidence.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What was more important to the Mayans here is that the stairs add up
          to one solar year. We also see 52 alcoves, probably referring back to
          the Haab calendar cycles consisting of 52 years. We also have cenotes
          going out in all four weather directions. A cenote is a pit or
          sinkhole that may occur after a collapse of limestone, revealing the
          groundwater beneath. If you picture a large well, you are close
          enough. So its importance for water supply is a given. They were also
          vital for sacrificial reasons, especially for the Itza Maya in the
          Yucutan peninsula. People were sacrificed in the cenotes to the
          rain-god <em>Chaac</em>. Of course, not all cenotes were used for
          sacrifices, but two of the four we have in Chitzen Itza have evidence
          of the practice.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we know little about the prehispanic version of
          Kukuklan. But the Itza idea of the feathered serpent spread through
          the Mayan culture and was picked up by the Aztecs. What's interesting
          about it is that it's a dualistic god; it has feathers and flies and
          still can serpentine on its belly down on earth.
        </p>
        <h2 id="whitegods">White gods</h2>
        <p>
          I think it's crucial to at least bring up here that Quetzalcoatl is,
          by some of these "alternative history" proponents, believed to be
          evidence of white people in the Americas pre-Colombus. In a previous
          episode, we covered the shortlived colony of Vikings in northern
          Canada, but this claim is different. We have encountered the idea
          about white people or gods in America in earlier episodes but let's
          look into this claim about Quetzalcoatl. They don't bring this up in
          the episode, but this might be an excellent place to explore this
          idea.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea is not new, not at all. The white god theory comes in many
          forms and from a few different places. We have the to us now famous
          authors like David Childress in his books "<em
            >Lost Cities of North &amp; Central America</em
          >" and "<em>Lost Cities of Atlantis.</em>" We see this claim in Graham
          Hancocks' "<em>Fingerprints of the Gods</em>" more than once. But the
          Mormons also support this idea since it's in their scripture that
          white Israelites came to America. But let's wind back the tape and see
          if we can find this claim's earliest mention or origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we do this, we end up with Ger&oacute;nimo (Jer&oacute;nimo) de
          Mendieta, a Franciscan missionary and chronicler who lived between
          1525&ndash;1604. In his work "<em
            >Historia eclesi&aacute;stica indiana"</em
          >
          volume two, chapter 10 (2.10), we learn about some of the histories of
          Quetzalcoatl. de Mendieta probably based this on the now-lost writings
          of Andr&eacute;s de Olmos, another priest operating a bit earlier than
          de Mendieta. But in this chapter, we learn that Quetzacoatl (or
          Kukulkan) was described as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He was a white man, tall in body, broad forehead, large eyes, long
          black hair, and large round beard."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "Era hombre blanco, crecido de cuerpo, ancha la frente, los ojos
          grandes, los cabellos largos y negros, la barba grande y redonda"
        </p>
        <p><em>Historia eclesi&aacute;stica indiana 2.10</em></p>
        <p>
          This is the earliest description of Quetzalcoatl as a white person;
          this description does not exist in any prehispanic sources. If you, my
          listener, have an earlier source, please send it in, but I've looked,
          and I've not found any. It's not only me who struggles to find an
          earlier source; we would all be happy to be proven wrong. The writings
          of de Mendieta inspire similar depictions of <em>Veracocha</em> in
          Peru. As with these claims, they tend to spread and be reworked, like
          a very long game of telephone.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the idea is festering, but it's not until the American congressman
          Ignatius Donnelly we see a connection between white gods and Atlantis.
          Donnelly was a politician, Shakespear denier, and Atlantis believer.
          Building on the ideas of again Blavatsky and Steiner, he argued that
          the Atlanteans were a population of white people who went around and
          taught people how to be a civilization. If you were to read his book
          <em>Atlantis: The Antediluvian World</em>, you would quickly learn how
          his idea of an advanced neolithic society is similar to Hancocks'
          ideas about a lost civilization. In this book, Donnelly, based on the
          works of D&eacute;sir&eacute; Charnay, claim that the Toltecs were
          white. On page 349, it's stated that Quetzalcoatl is white, and both
          the Toltecs and Quetzacoatl originate from Atlantis.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also heard these strange claims that since the people of
          Mesoamerica can't grow beards, it must have been the Europeans they
          talked about. Again taking de Menditas' history and adding a layer of
          racism. Note that neither Childress, Hancock, nor other
          <em>alternative history</em> promoters really deal with the racist
          origins of their claims. They just hope you won't go and look any of
          this up and will fight you if you call them on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I think we will return later to the "<em>White Gods</em>" theory
          because they play quite a role in this universe. We didn't really get
          into the Mormon angle here, either. As we learned back in episode 22,
          the LDS history is weird. But for now, we will leave this part of the
          world, and after the break, we will look into some rituals that the
          alien proponents claim to be evidence of visitation.
        </p>
        <h2 id="beltane">Beltane Festival</h2>
        <p>
          Let's return to the proof for Ancient Astronauts. The show will now
          bring up two ceremonies that, as evidence, are pretty weak. The first
          is the festivities of Beltane, a Celtic celebration celebrated in the
          spring by lighting fires. This festival comes down to us through
          Gaelic dictionaries such as Sanas Cormaic. The earliest reference to
          this is during 900 BCE. The Ancient Alien proponents claim that this
          celebration was an attempt to recreate the lights from UFOs:s that the
          celts had seen. It's also claimed that it was believed that portals
          opened up during this time. The Celts, Scandinavians, and Balts indeed
          celebrated the start of spring with lightning fires. But this was not
          to recreate UFO lights but to scare away spirits. Even the fires in
          homesteads were extinguished and re-lit. The entry of spring was a
          celebration of life and rebirth in a sense. The UFO angle seems quite
          silly here, or more than usual.
        </p>
        <h2 id="bepkororoti">Bep Kororoti</h2>
        <p>
          The second celebration originates in Brazil. The show starts to talk
          about a tribe called Kayapo and a ceremony performed within this
          tribe. We see a figure dressed in an oversized costume that seems to
          be woven, and this figure is supposed to be called Bep Kororoti (or
          Bepkororoti). The show claim that this person is trying to resemble an
          astronaut and the tribe is celebrating an extra-terrestrial
          visitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show does something in this segment that, if you have followed
          along and watched these episodes might have noticed. We have Giorgio
          on the screen telling us something originally claimed by Von
          D&auml;niken. This particular case is from D&auml;nikens' 1973 book
          "<em>Gold of the gods</em>."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Kayapo tribe refers to themselves as Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre,
          meaning "<em>the men from the water hole</em>." The name Kayap&oacute;
          originated during the 1800s, was coined by other groups, and
          translates to "<em>those who look like monkeys</em>." This is probably
          not referring to the physical look of the people but to a ritual using
          masks. The Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre lives in central Brazil, in an area
          large as Austria and covered in rainforest. They have unfortunately
          struggled for a long time to be able to keep their land since other
          settlements are closing in. Several NGOs are trying to help the tribes
          to acquire the rights to their land, and if you wish to help, you can
          visit the Kayapo project.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre are a real tribe. So far, so good, I
          guess. Even if I have some opinions on using a name, the people do not
          prefer. But how is it with this Bep Kororoti (Bepkororoti) character
          the show talks about? Well, here it gets murky. Von D&auml;niken claim
          in <em>Gold of the Gods</em> that Jo&atilde;o Am&eacute;rico Peret
          visited the tribe in 1952 and learned the story about this spaceman.
          We get the story about how the Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre meets this
          strange man in a suit who they can't hurt with their weapons. The
          figure finds this amusing and then demonstrates a powerful sticklike
          weapon that pulverizes some stones and threes. Von D&auml;niken also
          makes quite a deal that this is way before Yuri Gagarin's trip to
          space in 1961. So how would they have this spacesuit-like figure?
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Von D&auml;niken did not give a reference, it was pretty tricky
          to find Peret's own account of this. It's not presented in the text or
          in the small reference list at the back of the book. I did not have
          any luck in the books written by Peret available and was close to
          giving up when I had some luck. Jo&atilde;o Am&eacute;rico Peret tells
          this story in an article for the weekly Brazilian magazine O Cruzeiro
          in the issue published on the 29th of march 1972. In the article "<em
            >Bep-kororoti o guerreiro do espa&ccedil;o</em
          >" or "<em>Bep-Kororoti space warrior</em>," Peret talks about this
          conversation taking place in 1962.&nbsp;&nbsp;

        <p>
          Bep Kororoti (Bepkororoti) is known from the anthropological records.
          For example, Claude Levi-Strauss discusses this figure in his book
          "<em>The Raw and the Cooked</em>" in 1969. In it, we learn that
          Bep-Kororoti (Bepkororoti) was a powerful shaman who, after gutting a
          tapir, was only left with two paws by his greedy friends. Taking
          revenge, he shaved his head and climbed a hill to control lightning
          with his wand. An interesting tidbit that explains this suit is that
          the Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre are skilled beekeepers. They have colonies
          and use different species of bees, some even stingerless. Bep-Kororoti
          among the Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre is usually associated with rain and
          thunder, but due to his mortal beginning, he is fond of honey.
          Etnobiologist Darrell Posey talks about how the Meb&ecirc;ng&ocirc;kre
          leaves honey in the wild nest they open. This is so the bees will
          return later, but traditionally people of the tribe have done this so
          Bep Kororoti will get his share.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the suite is to keep bees and not get stung. Jason Colavito landed
          on the same conclusion in his exploration of the subject. So while we
          see similarities between Jo&atilde;o Am&eacute;rico Peret's telling
          and other anthropological collections. I'm not sure why Peret's
          telling differs from the other anthropological work, he might have
          influenced the group, or the myth evolved. I can't find any instances
          of this story after or before Peret, it does not mean it's not true,
          but we should keep it with some skepticism.
        </p>
        <h2 id="monarchyalien">Is the monarchy alien?&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          This next part is giving me quite some David Icke vibes. Not that we
          will discuss shapeshifting Jewish reptilians here today, but this is a
          tad silly. The show proposes that kings are a tradition either
          instituted by aliens or kings are trying to emulate aliens. This is a
          bit unclear, to be honest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We start with the <em>Stone of Scone</em> or, as the show put it,
          <em>The stone of destiny</em>. This name is not wrong but make it
          sound fancier than it is. This stone is a stone on which the king or
          queen sits during the coronation ceremony. Or nowadays, it's beneath a
          bench on which the monarch sits.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, the show claims the stone is from outer space. But
          since it's out of Old Red Sandstone, quarried close to the Scottish
          village Scone. Other being named for a tasty bread, the townlet was
          the coronation place for Scottish royalty once.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We descend into a section of loose threads they try to tie together.
          But the main argument is that we kings are viewed as gods. In some
          cultures, this is true. That's one reason, for example, why Alexander
          the Great conquered Egypt. It was the one place he could be a literal
          god on earth. But while religion and monarchy have had close ties,
          most cultures have had different approaches to how the king is viewed.
          In the Maya world, the king was a high priest, as we have seen, while
          in Rome, some emperors were deified upon their death.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If we look at Catholic Europe, the kings were ordained or chosen by
          god but didn't speak for god or was a representative of god. The idea
          of what a king, emperor, chieftain, ajaw, or any other name for the
          role differs widely between societies. But luckily, they have hidden
          some clues within the coronation. Again we have the Eurocentric
          approach but okay, let's see what it is.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It's part of the regalia of the monarch, the scepter. You know how the
          rod looks like an Ankh, the Egyptian symbol. Yeah, neither did I. But
          this is the claim they make with this little fact from Jason Martell.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Ankh is always a symbol used in Pharaonic times as a scepter.
            But an interesting play on the word, Ankh, shows that also stems
            from the word Anunnaki, which meant, those who from heaven came to
            earth.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>- Jason Martell</p>
        <p>
          What Jason does here is to smash two words together without
          understanding them. The Ankh is an Egyptian symbol representing three
          sounds that form this word. In no form is the word or even the sounds
          related to Annunaki; that's just some sort of pareidolia for words. If
          we translate it, Ankh would mean "key of life." Even the translation
          of Annunaki that Martell gives is wrong, as we have covered many times
          now, is false. It's something Zacharia Sitchin invented and now for
          those in the back. Annunaki would be translated to something like "of
          princely seed."&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Ankh has its place in Egyptian depictions of the pharaohs,
          it was never used as a scepter. In fact, the Egyptian Pharaoh already
          had a scepter, which we have drawings dating back to pre-dynastic
          times. Add to this the staffs we have found from the first dynasty.
          Not one but several, both in Abydos and Saqqara. The finest example is
          the scepter of the Pharaoh Khasekhemwy. Found by Petrie in 1901; I
          recommend you go and look it up.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ankh scepter connection might not be the evidence that would blow
          this thing open. But we should start using our heads because have you
          thought about the crowns?
        </p>
        <p>
          If not the stick work, you got to use your head. Jason Martell returns
          with another Annunaki claim that they had a glow around them. From the
          light, we're supposed to think about halos. The Annunaki Angel
          connection here is made, so we start to think about things that can be
          put on the head to represent aliens, I guess? We don't really have to
          think about this claim too hard for it to be silly. People have always
          needed to differentiate themself from others; this becomes even more
          visible when we look at monarchs. The best way to stand out is to have
          visible headgear. Usually, these segments have some anchor to make
          them sound more plausible, but I'm not sure what happened in this one.
          It's just been a collection of silly claims. I don't know about you,
          but we need a break here. When we return, we will investigate how much
          energy prayer generates and the Egyptian boat mystery.
        </p>
        <h2 id="olmecs">Olmecs and Shamans</h2>
        <p>
          So this last section has some more fun things to bring us. This next
          segment is going a little bit all over the place. We start first with
          the Olmecs, the mother culture of Mesoamerica. They are most known for
          the giant stone-heads we found 17 of. These are large affairs, with
          full lips and sporting something that looks like a helmet. This has
          resulted in some quite interesting alternative theories of Olmec
          origin. Even in 1850, when the first stone was uncovered in Veracruz,
          the ideas of Africans sailing over to Mesoamerica and starting the
          Olmec culture began to appear. This culminated in 1980 with the short
          story "The olec football player" by Kathleen Smith, in which an
          Afro-American football player traveled back in time. Culminated and
          culminated, I'm maybe not so sure about that. These ideas tend to
          appear every so often.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, what will the show claim about these colossal heads? Well, not
          much; they use the heads to talk about something else. I'll let Fiebag
          take the wheel.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 10px">

            class="img-fluid"
            alt="Olmec head"
          />
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The mother culture of Central America, were the Olmecs. In old
            images made by the Olmecs, we can see helmeted beings dressed in
            overalls ascending. They have wings and they have microphones almost
            in front of their mouths. Are these the heads of rulers or priests?
            Or were they maybe aliens that they wanted to portray?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>Peter Fiebag</p>
        <p>
          It's unclear what images Fiebag refers to here, but I don't recognize
          them, and I've not found these examples. A more common motif would be
          shamans transforming into jaguars; this transformation is sometimes
          depicted in small children. We also see concepts that will be
          important in Mayan cultures, such as twins and dwarfs. Fiebag is
          correct in the statement that the Olmecs can be viewed as the mother
          culture of Mesoamerica.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But from the giant heads, we get into the concept of shamans, and here
          we will have a segment dominated by Nancy Red Star, Clifford Mahooty,
          and Standing Elk. I'm not going to get into what they say here because
          myths evolve and expand. I mean, Christianity has more than 45 000
          dominations; that's big enough that we know about them. I'm not going
          to pretend to know more about the Native American religion and just
          have the approach leave it at this is one version of many.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="electroscope">Electroscope and the power of prayer</h2>
        <p>
          But now it's time for what you might been waiting for; how much energy
          does a prayer produce? The show gets to this question by following the
          Olmec shamans, to the Native American religions, through the horseshoe
          valley. It is quite the trip, and we are led to believe that dr
          Boguslaw Lipinski has proved that prayer is real and has energy
          output. Dr. Lipinski got his degree in Biochemistry at Uniwersytet
          Warszawski and seems to do decent work in cancer research. So his
          field is not related to this claim that originates from an article
          published in 2009 on Medjugorje USA. The report was named "<em
            >Scientific study</em
          >," Lipinski claims to have measured prayer output with an
          Electroscope in Medjugorje in today's Bosnia Herzegovina. This
          experiment took place in 1985 with a "rechargeable Electroscope
          (BT-400, Biotech-Electronics, Lachine, Que. Canada)". Ancient Aliens
          and Lipinski refer to the country as Yoguslavia for reasons probably
          only known to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you might ask yourself, what is an Electroscope? I wondered that,
          too, and the short answer is a crude volt meter. The electroscope was
          invented in the 1600s by William Gillbert; to be honest, it has mostly
          stayed the same since. I don't know if this is the tool Lipinsky
          refers to. But since we don't have anything else to go on, we have to
          assume he refers to the proper device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lipinsky claims that he managed to measure high electric charges and
          radiation when people prayed in the room. But from what I can tell,
          neither Lipinski nor anyone else has replicated this. The method makes
          little sense since the charge must be close to the electroscope to
          register. The electroscope can "Detect ionizing radiation or an
          electric charge on a body," but it's within limits here. But luckily,
          you can build your own electroscope in your home and start replicating
          this study.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in all seriousness, reading the study, we will start to note the
          same issue many ghost hunters face. They don't know how to use the
          tools and interpret the data in a way that favors their preconceived
          notion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="ships">Ships, vessels, and starships</h2>
        <p>
          Let's move on to the stars! We are brought all the way back to Egypt
          for this last section of the show, where we will explore the meaning
          of vessels and cremations. We open up on a thrilling discovery in 1952
          of Khufu's funerary boat, a 45-meter (or 150 feet) large vessel made
          out of cedars from Lebanon. The ship is strange for reasons other than
          aliens, it has no place for a mast, and the oars are really too small
          to be functional on the boat. The leading theory today is that this
          was a funerary vessel made to bring the dead Pharaoh from the east to
          the land of the dead in the west. It was indeed not for your daily
          sailing. Phillip Coppens explains this boat like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >In the case of King Khufu, we find there is a literal boat thought
            to be a boat of a million years, even though this might appear to be
            a normal ship, it is actually something far more, it can almost
            represent a spaceship because they just didn't speak of years, they
            spoke millions of years, and this is precisely what space travel is
            all about. Somehow, the dead body was able to go on this voyage</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>Philip Coppens</p>
        <p>
          Now the idea of the boat comes from Ra's daily expedition across the
          sky and predestined return to the underworld. Yes, the Egyptians
          believed that you traveled west and down. Not up to heaven; this is
          something the Alien crowd has invented. So if you were rich, you could
          have a large boat, and the middle class may have a smaller model. If
          your means were tight, the coffin would suffice with the right spells,
          of course.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have a short appearance from Robert Bauval, who claims the
          word for god in Ancient Egypt was neter/neteru and translates to "<em
            >a being that came from the cosmos.</em
          >" Where he got this idea is highly unclear, the glyph representing
          this word looks like a flag on a pole or maybe an axe. Its meaning is
          a bit murky, but the most accepted translation is strength or power.
          This can change; it's still being pondered on, but Bauvals'
          translation does not fit, and he's offered no explanation for how he
          got there.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we continue this idea of boat, meaning spaceship, to my dismay, by
          going north. To my home, to my stone ships. For the love of Thor. Yes,
          they will now claim that the Stone Ships/Ship setting in Sweden is
          evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 10px">

        <p>
          We will hear that these stone formations are graves. While this is
          true to some extent, it's not the whole truth. The show also claims
          that these are from the Viking era, and some are, but not all. The
          Stone Ships sometimes have burials within them or are located close to
          or on a grave field. But most commonly, they were close to the old
          coastlines, and a theory is that while being part of the funerary
          rites, they were also points of navigation. The oldest Stone Ship
          dates to the Scandinavian bronze age, and the tradition of portraying
          ships stems from there. In Scandinavian petroglyphs, one of the more
          common depictions is ships, which seems to have been crucial to the
          people of the time. Either due to trade or other reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also find different types of ship burials, and these were rarely
          cremation-type burials and are pretty famous due to their rich grave
          goods. The most famous example might be the Oseberga ship from Norway.
          This ship is more or less intact and was buried with what we assume
          was a royal individual with quite impressive goods. At first, only
          half of the vessel was covered by the Tumulus, leaving the other side
          open, and there's an idea that the open part was used as a stage. Ship
          burials were not only for men; we have examples of women being buried
          this way too. Take grave 36 on Birka in Stockholm. From the skeletal
          remains, it seems to have been a woman. Also, with rich grave goods,
          this should not be confused with the woman's "warrior grave" that has
          upset some strange people recently.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So are these graves evidence of aliens? I doubt it; the evolution and
          connection to the culture of Scandinavia would not make any sense if
          they tried to emulate alien spaceships. Also, why did they try to
          emulate accurate ships in Egypt and Sweden if they did not have to
          sail? Why build it like the type of vessels they had and not like a
          saucer?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this episode seems to be a bust again, unfortunately. It was not
          really the strongest episode they have put together so far. We may
          have better luck next time when we examine Aliens and ancient
          engineers! If you're waiting for me to tackle Graham Hancocks' latest
          series, "Ancient Apocalpse," don't worry; there is something in the
          pipeline. But so many excellent archaeologists, historians, and others
          have done a great job with his show already, so I want to do something
          extra for you all.&nbsp;
