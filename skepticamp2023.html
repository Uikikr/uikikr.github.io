        <p>
          Hello everyone! Before we start, a quick show of hands. How many of
          you have seen "Ancient Apocalypse" on Netflix?
        </p>
        <p>
          Wow, what did you all do to deserve that? Don't you have better things
          to do? For those of you who made the far superior choice of not
          watching Ancient Apocalypse, it is a series over at Netflix where
          Graham Hancock claims that a group of white Atlanteans survived
          Atlantis's destructions. The Atlanteans built all the prominent
          monuments to warn coming humans about a future comet strike that would
          end the world. In the process, they also spread culture and
          civilization to the primitive non-Alanteans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who is this Graham Hancock, then? He is a journalist who, early in his
          career, realized that being silenced was a good marketing ploy. Since
          then, he has gone at every opportunity and claimed to be persecuted by
          those horrible archaeologists in their ivory tower, proclaimed being
          enemy number one among archaeologists. A bold and untrue statement. We
          all know that number one is our knees, and the second is our hate/love
          relation with the problematic Indiana Jones.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't have time to go into detail on Hancock's background and
          inspirations. But the short story is that Graham bases his ideas on
          theosophy writers such as Helena Blavatsky and Rudolf Steiner. Both
          have some concerning theories on race, something Gram carries with him
          and mixes with the theses of Ignatius Donnelly. An American politician
          who was an Atlantis believer and Shakespear denier. Donnelly suggested
          that the primitive people worldwide could not have created all the
          wonders by themselves. So he stated there must have been an advanced
          culture, of course white, in prehistoric times. This civilization was
          then ended by a meteor strike. But a few survivors were left behind,
          traveling the globe. Didn't we just hear this? Well, Hancock added a
          few things and went with it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Note here that Hancock only uses esoteric ideas for his foundation of
          the theory. A common mistake among critics is that they assume Hancock
          is a wannabe archaeologist or historian. Dr. Jeb Card Graham best: "He
          is a successful mythographer in a post-science age." Hancocks
          Atlanteans with superpowers are successors to elves or mythical
          beings. Graham searches for esoteric sacred knowledge from shamanic
          journeys fueled by psychedelic drugs like ayahuasca. Building a new
          origin myth built on perennial wisdom. From this starting point, he
          goes out and cherry-picks historical and archaeological sites that
          kind of fit in with his esoteric charter myth. So, criticizing Hancock
          solely from an archaeological or historical perspective is to miss his
          point. Much of the evidence is based on theosophy and the Sleeping
          Prophet Edgar Cayce.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what's the harm then? Why not let Graham and the others drink
          ayahuasca, puke, and have their visions? The damage comes in many
          shapes and forms, and many of them affect the actual word. This
          includes the destruction of sites, state funding of psuedoscience,
          threats, and refusal to give indigenous people different land
          rights.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, we see the destruction of sites at Gungung Padang in
          Indonesia. Most scholars agree that the site is a Punden Berundak. But
          geologists Danny Hilman and Ali Akbar claim it's a pyramid up to
          20,000 years old, a date based on problematic C14 samples. They used
          two core samples but didn't know what they tested, if it was
          contaminated, or been able to explain the sequence. There are just a
          few centimeters between extreme periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the team got money from the previous government, which wanted to
          create a new nationalistic monument. The excavation was dubbed
          "Operation to Honor Red and White," referencing the Indonesian flag.
          We know that the initial funding for the project was almost equal to
          the yearly budget of Bandung Archaeological Center. A budget that is
          supposed to cover preservation, research, and salaries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The excavation seems to have been done poorly, lacking methodology,
          oversight, and publications. Uptowards 500 people worked the site,
          including conscripted soldiers. We don't know the damage this
          excavation has created, but it will make further research
          harder.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In Bosnia, we see a similar story where Osman Osmanagic claims a hill
          in Visoko is a pyramid. He is to receive funding for excavations in an
          area with known historic sites. It might be worth mentioning that the
          historical museum in Sarajevo was still struggling with funding for
          repairs from the Bosnian war.
        </p>
        <p>
          These examples also include threats towards archaeologists and
          historians who criticize these projects. One of Bosnia's leading
          archaeologists, Kujundzic-Vejzagic, stood open in her critique was
          painted as an enemy of Bosnia. Unfortunately, we see this tactic
          often, from YouTube comments to trying to weaponize "rate my
          professor." Even Hancock is not below putting out contact info to the
          people who denied him a filming permit for his documentary. The
          Serpent Mound declined Hancock's team's multi-day filming permit,
          something Hancock has weaponized for extra media attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have when pseudo-history influenced political decisions
          affecting indigenous people. A few such decision was based on the
          ideas of the Norwegian national hero Thor Heyerdahl, who might be most
          famous for his trip across the Pacific in a raft. But Heyerdahl also
          argued that the culture of Peru and South America originated from a
          white race who brought construction, art, science, and civilization to
          this area, just to be forced out by the primitive Inka. Heyerdahl
          partially got this belief from the idea of white gods in Meso and
          South America. However, these descriptions did not exist until the
          conquistador's chroniclers arrived. The first mention of white gods in
          America can be traced to Geronimo de Mendieta during the late 1500s.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of gods like Quetzalcoatl and Viracocha being white
          influenced Heyerdahl and later Graham Hancock. This is an example of
          how the scientific racism of the early 1900s still survives due to the
          alternative historians. But Heyerdahl's theories of an original white
          people were used by then president Bustamente to turndown land-claim
          from the Quechua people. Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay also adopted
          this argument for the same reason. These ideas are, in turn, used
          today by alt-right and neo nazis to justify their views of being a
          "superior race" and denying the indigenous people land and rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this is the grim reality of the effects of pseudo-history promoted
          by, among others, Hancock and, in turn, Netflix. But knowing these
          theories are based on esoteric ideas fueled by plastic shamanism and
          ayahuasca will improve our pushback.&nbsp;
