          Let's dust off our thinking hats and join in exploring two special
          objects surrounded by strange claims. First, we will spend time with
          four golden hats from the European Bronze Age. Some claim they
          functioned as priestly antennas, but how do they fit into the Bronze
          Age cult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we will move on to the Copper Scrolls, one of the maybe more
          mysterious documents in the Dead Sea Scroll collection. It's a
          treasure map written on copper and hidden in a cave. That Indiana
          Jones, Nic Cage, or any other treasure movie franchise has not picked
          this story up yet is potentially one of our larger mysteries in this
          episode. Hold on to your hat, and let's set out to find some treasure.

          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in
          popular media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 57, and I am Fredrik. Your humble guide into the
          realm of strange claims and pseudo-science. Let's dust off our
          thinking hats and join in exploring two objects brought up in the
          Ancient Alien episode "Relics" from Season 6, episode 8. First, we
          will spend time with four golden hats from the European Bronze Age.
          Some claim they functioned as priestly antennas, but how do they fit
          into the Bronze Age cult. Then we will move on to the Copper Scrolls,
          one of the maybe more mysterious scrolls in the Dead Sea Scroll
          collection. It's a treasure map written on copper and hidden in a
          cave. That Indiana Jones, Nic Cage, or any other treasure movie
          franchise has not picked this story up yet is potentially one of our
          larger mysteries in this episode. Hold on to your hat, and let's set
          out to find some treasure.&nbsp;

          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="goldenhat">The Golden Hats</h2>
        <p>
          We rarely discuss European history and archaeology on this show. So,
          I'm more than happy to present some artifacts related to the
          Scandinavian Bronze Age. While the artifacts are not Scandinavian,
          I'll soon get into why they are related. First of all, what are we
          even talking about? Hold on to your hats because four golden hats.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are cone-shaped hats hammered into shape from one sheet of gold.
          Four known examples of these hats exist, and they most likely had some
          organic material on the inside to make them more comfortable to wear.
          Today, three of them are located in Germany: the Ezelsdorf-Buch hat,
          the Berlin hat, and the Hat of Schifferstadt. While the Ezelsdorf-Buch
          and Schifferstadt hats have a known provenance, the origin of the
          Berlin golden hat is unknown. Scholars believe it most likely
          originated in Switzerland. Then, we have the fourth example, the
          Avanton Gold Cone, found in France in 1844.
        </p>
        <p>
          These cones or hats are 30 to 80 centimeters tall and weigh around a
          half kilo. They are richly decorated and were created during the
          European Bronze Age; interestingly, we can see influences from Nordic
          countries and Medetirrenian influences from Sardinia. But let's see
          what the Ancient Aliens say about these hats.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">
          "<em
            >The golden hats are kind of interesting, because if gold is
            something that actually enhances your connection with energies and
            higher-up celestial beings, then the wearing of a golden hat,
            especially in a conical shape, would tend to amplify the signal that
            you were getting from on high. So, it seems to me that ancient
            cultures logically would build them to get connected with the gods
            who had perhaps left them behind and gone back to their celestial
            birthplace.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>– Michael Bara</p>
        <p>
          I must tip my hat to Michael Bara, who has at least created an
          exciting narrative. The hats were antennas to strengthen the signal
          between the extraterrestrials and their spokespersons on Earth. I find
          this amusing and would do it for fun Sci-Fi or fantasy elements.
          However, they are trying to claim that these ideas are scientifically
          rooted in sound science. So, if all that it takes is a half-meter
          antenna to connect with the aliens, why haven't any of our humungous
          telescopes picked up a single beep. Except, of course, for the 1977
          "Wow! signal" the Ohio State University Radio Observatory picked up.
          While we don't know precisely what the "Wow! signal" was or if it's
          even artificial, it might be one of the few cases where an
          extraterrestrial solution might be plausible. So I'm sorry, but if our
          largest telescope, the "Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical
          Telescope," and people complain that archaeologists don't have any
          fantasy regarding names, don't pick up alien signals. Why would a
          small gold cone do that? The radio telescope I mentioned is 500 meters
          in diameter and is located in China, also known as the "Heaven's Eye."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, if these golden cones were not intended to be used as a car
          antenna, what were they used for? If we look closer at the hats,
          especially the Berlin Gold hat, we can see a pattern of what seems to
          be suns and moons repeated in a distinct pattern. With this
          arrangement, we get a solar and lunar cycle stretching over 19 years;
          from this, you could calculate 228 solar months and 235 lunar months.
          So, if you were a king or a priest who could read this pattern, you
          could foresee lunar eclipses, calculate the shifts, and be able to set
          fixed events in the year. We see the same pattern and possibility
          within the other three cones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't think about this as an outlier, though; we see astronomical
          representation and understanding in other artifacts from the European
          Bronze Age. Emilia Pasztor, for example, describes how sun dogs,
          halos, and round atmospheric phenomenons with four spokes are
          repeatedly represented in Bronze Age material. This shows that the sun
          and the moon were significant in Bronze Age societies. Then, we have
          several other artifacts with an astronomical connection, such as the
          German Nebra Sky Disc, the Danish Trundholm sun chariot, the Balåkra
          drum from Sweden, and the Kokino site. Kokino is an extinct volcano in
          North Macedonia that served as a Bronze Age observatory.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly, these cones or hats were connected to the sun cult dominating
          the European Bronze Age. While the finds seem to be in areas connected
          to the Urnfield culture, it's not sure it fits in. Looking at the hat,
          we see a connection to Scandinavia; for example, in the King's Grave
          in Kivik in Scania, we have petroglyphs that depict similar conic
          hats. We also have a set of figures found in Stockhult in, Sweden;
          these figures have conic hats with brims that remind one of the golden
          hats. A similar set of figures has also been found in Denmark. Looking
          at the Bronze Age petroglyphs in Sweden, it's pretty clear that they
          imported elements and gods from the continent. Elements from Cyprus,
          Minoan, and even Egypt can be found looking at the petroglyphs,
          especially in southern Sweden.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While I do enjoy the image of a Bronze Age priest pulling up the gold
          cone like an old car antenna, it's simply fiction. These hats fit
          pretty well into the culture of the Bronze Age. That hats were used as
          a power symbol is still something that we have today; just look at
          most religions and royalty. From the beginning of stratified
          societies, humans have sought ways to make those in power more
          visible.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          From European hat fashion, we will venture to the Dead Sea for our
          next artifact.
        </p>
        <h2 id="copperscroll">Copper Scrolls</h2>
        <p>
          The Dead Sea Scrolls are a collection of old texts that I think many
          are familiar with. They were first found by Beduin shepherds in 1946
          in the Qumran caves. Some 970 manuscripts have been found in twelve
          different caves. They are written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. But
          we will focus on one manuscript today, and it stands apart for several
          reasons. One is that it was written on copper.
        </p>
        <p style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)">
          "<em
            >All the Dead Sea Scrolls that have been found were written on
            either leather or papyrus. The Copper Scroll is the only one made of
            copper. You got to keep in mind, copper was valuable, and to hammer
            out a whole scroll would take a lot of time and a lot of technique,
            so it has to be very important.</em
          >" - John de Salvo.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important question to settle before we move forward is when this
          document was written. Scholars like Ze'ev Safrai put the date
          somewhere in the middle of the first century CE. This is based on
          paleography,&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          which is the study of ancient and historical handwriting. This
          discipline involves analyzing how letters and words were formed in
          manuscripts, enabling researchers to date and authenticate old texts,
          understand historical contexts, and decipher writings no longer in
          use. It can also be used to date a document based on the writing and
          its content.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When it's called the copper scroll, this is quite a literal name. The
          creator has put a lot of effort into making the copper sheets look
          like the vellum or leather sheets and other documents stored in the
          Qumram caves. The plates were even rolled up when first discovered;
          two pages were rolled together, and a third page was rolled
          separately. Rivets were initially holding the pair scroll together;
          these have been lost to time. So it was important that this document
          looked and was treated like the other documents in the Dead Sea Scroll
          collection. You might wonder what was written in this scroll, and I'll
          have John de Salvo sum it up for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Copper Scroll lists 64 locations in Jerusalem and around that
          area that buried treasure is located. Maybe the key is, in the 64th
          location, it says there's another copper scroll that will help explain
          the rest of it. Because we haven't found the treasure yet. I somehow
          suspect there could be another code within this treasure map, a code
          within a code."
        </p>
        <p>
          De Salvo is correct in that this document seems to describe different
          locations with treasure. A treasure that's not been found today. To
          some extent, we have a real mystery, but before you grab a shovel and
          book a trip to Jerusalem, we should put this document in its
          historical context. I also want to give some examples from the recent
          reexamination of the document by Émile Puech. Puech suggests a new
          reading of the document and that the number of locations is not 64 but
          60 based on this new translation. Lefkovits suggested that it would be
          60 locations back in 2000. The translation of the Copper Scroll is
          tricky because it's written in older Hebrew. While ample documents and
          dictionaries cover old Hebrew, almost all are religious. Making the
          translations of secular texts like this a bit more challenging since
          not all words are defined in this context. Let's read the document to
          understand its structure and what it tells us a bit. This is from the
          first column, rows one to five, as translated by Puech.

          Sounds almost like JRR Tolkien when he had that whole section about
          the dwarfs divvying up the treasure in Bilbo. Or add Nick Cage in a
          lather jacket, and you could have a National Treasure 6 movie without
          much more effort. As we hear, the document really sounds like a
          real-life treasure map. It's a little bit beyond me how this has not
          been turned into a movie yet. At the same time, you might start to
          wonder why people are not out there in their leather jackets and
          looking for the vast quantities of gold and silver the document talks
          about. Just to list a small part of the treasure, it supposedly
          contains 165 bars of gold, 19 bars of silver, and 362 gold talents
          (during the Second Temple Period, to which this text would date, one
          talent is about 34 kg or 74 pounds) and 1 672 talents of silver. What
          I counted up here is just a tiny portion of the stuff we have in the
          scrolls, but if we start to add up everything, it would be a lot of
          hidden riches. So where are the treasure hunters? People have spent
          unknown millions of dollars digging a hole on an island in Canada; why
          don't we see that effort here? Could it be made up?
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some discussions about this among scholars; some argue that
          there never was a treasure, while others think the treasure is real.
          Then we have the middle way, which often might be our best route. The
          Copper Scroll is not the first or only document we have found
          describing a hidden hoard of treasure. Ze'ev Safrai describes another
          document in an anthology of collected documents called&nbsp;Aggadat
          Bereshit&nbsp;by R. Abraham. In the Tractate Kelim document, we
          encounter a text strangely similar to what we can read in the Copper
          Scroll. Safrai has identified four main similarities between the two
          texts.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"(1) Tractate Kelim states the list was written by "Shimur the
            Levite and his colleagues on a copper plate."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >(2) According to Tractate Kelim, the vessels of the Temple made by
            King Solomon were hidden away, as were gold and silver hoards. The
            Copper Scroll contains a detailed description of hidden gold and
            silver treasure hoards.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >(3) Section 10 of Tractate Kelim states that some treasures were
            hidden in Kakhal Spring; in the Copper Scroll, "Kohlit" appears in a
            description of the hiding-places for five of the treasures.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >(4) Tractate Kelim notes that in addition to the treasures listed
            in the composition itself there exist additional treasures, and
            another scroll, which "nobody knows where it was concealed." In the
            concluding section of the Copper Scroll we read that "an additional
            copy of the list," with greater detail than the Copper Scroll
            itself, was hidden in a water cistern in Yanoah." -&nbsp;Exploring
            the Dead Sea Scrolls p. 116</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          From the start, we learn that other texts are claimed to have been
          written on copper plates and contain similar information as the Dead
          Sea Scroll. This is interesting; it seems this scroll belongs to a
          specific genre: treasury lists. Honestly, it could already be its own
          section in the bookstore. How many books about treasure hunting aren't
          there out there? Dan Brown and James Rollin have made some monumental
          contributions to it. The difference might be that the list doesn't
          contain many secret passages and runs in catacombs.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's more interesting is that these lists fit in with a tradition
          not in Israel but in Greece. Greek temples used to have lists of
          relics and treasure in their belongings written on stone tablets. We
          will return to this connection in a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before talking about the Greek connection, I want to discuss when the
          hiding of this gold and silver took place. Reading the Tractate Kelim,
          it becomes pretty clear the author is talking about the treasure from
          the First Temple. Mainly because the ark, menora, and the priest's
          breastplates are mentioned. These relics would not have been mentioned
          if the text had covered the Second Temple. So, does the Copper Scroll
          mention these items, too? Well, not really. While these plates mention
          "sacred vessels," they don't detail the vessels' contents. But it's
          not unlikely that these scrolls are built on an older source. If this
          list would describe the treasures of the Second Temple being hidden
          away, it must have been written after 70 CE. However, there are no
          signs of anyone visiting the Qumran caves after 68 CE. So, we hit a
          bit of a snag regarding whether the document is meant to detail the
          first or second temple. While authors like Safrai go into deep detail
          regarding the content of the copper scroll compared to the Tractate
          Kelim, we don't have any definitive evidence of the origin of the
          treasures. However, there could be another clue to this clue within
          the Greek connection I mentioned some moments ago.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, let's talk about the Greek Connection then. As I alluded to, a
          genre of treasure lists came from Greece and was connected to the
          temples. What I find interesting in particular is one example brought
          up by Weitzman. In Pausanias's book Description of Greece, 4.20.4, we
          learn that
          <i
            >"For the Messenians possessed a secret thing. If it were destroyed,
            Messene would be overwhelmed and lost forever, but if it were kept,
            the oracles of Lycus the son of Pandion said that after lapse of
            time the Messenians would recover their country."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Messenians were a region in South West Peloponnese in Ancient
          Greece. This region was invaded by the Spartans during the Classical
          period and forced into exile. While we never get to learn what these
          secrets are, there is quite an exciting connection further ahead when
          the future leader Epiteles rediscovered the secret things hidden away
          in the past. In passage 4.26.8, we're told,
          <i
            >"He took it at once to Epaminondas, told him the dream and bade him
            remove the lid and see what was within. Epaminondas, after sacrifice
            and prayer to the vision that had appeared, opened the urn and
            having opened it found some tin foil, very thin, rolled like a book.
            On it were inscribed the mysteries of the Great Goddesses, and this
            was the pledge deposited by Aristomenes."&nbsp;</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, it's written on tin, but again, we see this idea that
          the important secret was written on something durable so as not to be
          lost to time. Even if this still puts this claim firmly between the
          realm of fiction and reality, it's an interesting connection. Add to
          this the bronze plate found listing temple treasures of a Demotic
          temple in the Roman Era of ancient Egypt. It's quite clear that these
          metallic documents were not uncommon in the Greek and Roman eras. But
          they were written not only on metals but also on stone. One such
          example is a document found in a museum in Denmark, the Lindian Temple
          Chronicles. A 2,5 meter or 8 feet tall stone from the island of Rhodes
          dating back to 99 BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Weitzman points out, the narrative of the Lindian Chronicle is
          quite similar to that of 2 Maccabees. In addition to the story, this
          large stone slab contains an extensive list of temple inventory. This
          is not strange in itself for ancient Greece. We have treasury
          inventory lists going back to 400 BCE, especially from Athens,
          carefully describing what the treasury contains. At one point or
          another, a logistical issue started to become apparent. The temple had
          started collecting too many offerings and needed to devise an
          organized way to keep track of them. The solution, it seems, might
          have been to use their Greek alphabet as letter labels to keep track
          of this inventory. As I hope you remember, the Copper Scrolls had
          Greek letters on them, which potentially had a similar function.
          According to Weitzman, this way of using the Greek alphabet would
          explain its function in the Copper Scrolls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing in the Lindian Chronicle that might help us understand
          the Copper Scroll is that the items don't have to be present to be
          accounted for. Let's read a section from the stone. "since the temple
          of Athena Lindia is both most ancient and most honored [and] has been
          adorned with many beautiful offerings from the oldest times on account
          of the epiphany of the goddess, and [since] it happens that most of
          the offerings together with their inscriptions have been destroyed by
          time, with good fortune be it resolved by the Councilors and the
          Lindians."
        </p>
        <p>
          See how the author of the records notes that the temple is old and
          that some things will have been destroyed or lost simply by time
          passing. Further down in the record, we also learn how it was damaged
          by a temple fire. But even if it's still not there, the temple
          custodians still felt the need for the items to be accounted for. As
          Weitzman points out, it was crucial during the time in the culture to
          be able to hold the officials accountable. Something that would have
          been equally important within the Jewish society. If we read the Old
          Testament, we have several instances where the main character of the
          text proceeds to take inventory of temple treasures or offerings
          presented to god.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The inventory lists from Greece were displayed publicly in the
          temples, and a good case could be made that the Copper Plates were
          also initially in a more visible place. This way, the temples could
          disclose their offerings while at the same time giving an impression
          that everything was accounted for and in order. It was probably not
          that anyone appearing at the temples would be able to see the
          warehouse of gold and silver. But if suspicion arose, they could point
          toward the stone and show what they had, what was missing, and where
          it went. Even if the Copper Scroll or Tractate Kelim isn't referring
          to a vault, it gives the impression that its custodians knew where it
          was and what it contained down to the most minuscule fraction.
          Weitzman and others point out that the treasure is that way meant to
          be in a state between mythology and reality. Something Weitzman
          explains is also seen in the Greco-Roman world.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"/.../many temple treasures in the Greco-Roman period existed in an
            intermediate state, believed to be real but not available for
            inspection, not always where they were supposed to be or intact, and
            sometimes more fictive than existent as was the case with many of
            the treasures listed in the Lindian Chronicle. At certain moments,
            when the community felt it necessary to audit the temple inventory,
            the distinction might be clarified to the satisfaction of the
            community, but for much of a temple's history, the community would
            not have been in a position to directly confirm which items were
            actually in the temple and which were not, trusting that they were
            there but not knowing for certain until the next audit."</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while the Ancient Alien crowd wants to claim this is part of some
          metallic space library—maybe belonging to the golden library invented
          by Father Crespi in Argentina—the real story of the scroll is a far
          more intriguing mystery. It was designed to be both elusive and give
          an impression of accountability. Authors like Safrai might suggest
          that this is a document written by a sect as a testament to the future
          and building of the ideal Temple. On the other hand, Joan Taylor
          suggests it was written to preserve the Temple cult during times of
          occupation. Weitzman might be summarizing it best by claiming,
          <i
            >"it has been my argument that this was the purpose of the Copper
            Scroll as well: to confirm that a treasure that appeared to be
            missing was really there, absent but accounted for by those
            entrusted with its safekeeping."</i
