            could have sworn that it made a metallic sound on impact. The bird

          Howdy partner, nice to see you there. Take place by the fire while we
          continue the mission to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere
          in between on the TV show Ancient Aliens. With a background in
          archeology, our host Fredrik is trying to see what really did happen
          in our past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's brush off the dirt and get back up in the saddle as we finish
          the second half of episode one from season three (S03E01) called
          "Aliens in the old west."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We're going deep into America's early days and meeting its inhabitants
          that, according to some, tell strange tales of creatures not belonging
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we will cover the genesis of the Mormon church or "The Church of
          Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints." Are stories about angels and other
          beings evidence of an extraterrestrial influence on Joseph Smith? We
          look into the early days of church history and uncover a violent past
          with our scientific research. We unveil ties to the moundbuilder myth
          and a great dose of plastic shamanism.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, we learn about Blackfoot mythology and read poetry from Walt
          Whitman. There's also the fate of Ambrose Bierce and a strange flying
          creature in both California and Arizona.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 22! This time we're back
          in the old west to close up episode one of season three called "Aliens
          and the old west." We started this episode last time, and this is part
          two, but you can follow along even if you have not heard the first
          episode. Even if you definitely should go back and listen to it either
          now or after this episode. This time though, we will deal with Mormon
          history that, according to the show, contain more aliens than you
          thought. We will also discuss "The above people" from the Blackfoot
          tradition, Thunderbirds and poetry. So we have quite the episode for
          you before going into all that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Enough of me yammering; let's travel back in time and see if you
          really should slam the door on those Mormons.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mormons">Mormons</h3>
        <p>
          The show then decides that maybe we haven't talked enough about
          problematic people and racist notions. The narrator does not have to
          say more than "Palmyra New York" to send a cold shot down my spine.
          Some of you might have an idea now about what will come up. But we're
          going back to September 21, 1823. This is because the show will claim
          that this is the date when Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of
          Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (or Mormons as I'll refer to them
          as), met the Angel Moroni. The show also briefly shows the golden
          plates; a fun fact is that if the slabs existed, they would have
          weighed about 100 kg or 200 pounds each. Just picture Smith carrying
          these super heavy plates back to his cabin. The story of Joseph Smith
          is a weird blend of silly, stupid, racist, and dangerous. Since we
          have encountered the Mormons in the past, maybe we should look into
          them a little bit deeper due to the strange connection between the LDS
          church and Ancient Aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something worth remembering is that the history of the Mormon church
          is a strange tale filled with war, blood, and magical underwear. The
          church in 1800 was far from today's friendly and clean living church
          that today is worth about 100 Billion dollars. But they have done an
          excellent job in trying to erase the history that puts them in a bad
          light. If they've not been able to remove it, you'll note that they
          have downplayed much of it. So finding neutral information can be
          challenging. Take Wikipedia, for example; the pages about the LDS
          church are like a battleground between the church-friendly editors and
          other parties. As usual, I've tried to find as neutral sources as
          possible, and the websites and books used are listed in the show
          notes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="josephsmith">Joseph Smith and early LDS-History</h4>
        <p>
          How about we start from the beginning? Let's sit down and hear about
          the origin of this belief. Joseph Smith is an exciting and problematic
          character that could quickly fill several episodes. If you are after
          that, I would recommend

          hosted by Bryce Blankenagel. But little Jo was born on December 23,
          1805. He did spend much of his formative years during the Second Great
          Awakening. This is a time in the US when religions realized they
          needed to compete for customers. But this time of religious fervor
          would give Smiths some ideas for later life. But Joseph was a known
          huckster, cheater, and smooth talker in his youth, this would not
          really change, but he added the prophet later on. This is not me just
          making things up; Smith has had many run-ins with the law. Some minor
          offenses, but before his death, he had advanced to treason and
          conspiracy to murder a Governor of Illinois, just to name a few.&nbsp;

        </figure>
        <p>
          In his earlier years, Smith made his fortune, or what we should call
          it, by going door to door and claiming that there was treasure on the
          property. The story he told the owners was that with the help of
          magical seer stones, he had gained the location of the hidden wealth.
          You might be excused if you thought that Smith walked around, digging
          holes until the property owner got tired. But it was not Smith who did
          the digging; no, that was the owners' responsibility. Smith mainly sat
          on the side trying to ensure that the diggers followed god rules.
          Because if they did something that angered god, the treasure was moved
          to a new location, and they needed to start over. So all he did was
          lazily supervise a few men, and if they questioned this, god became
          angry. Out of this, Smith got a place to sleep, some food, and access
          to the daughters on the farm. I don't think we need to go into more
          detail here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the seer stones would make a return with the plates. This is
          because the Angel Moroni, I mean really, revealed the location of the
          tablets to Smith. Maybe it was an "I told you I could treasure";
          perhaps it was laziness, but Smith could translate these magical
          tablets with the seer stones. But no one was allowed to see the
          plates. Trey Parker and Matt Stone described this whole thing quite
          well in the South Park episode "<em>All about the Mormons</em>." Even
          if the "<em>Book of Mormons</em>" is the most known, they have two
          others that are canonized, the "<em>Doctrine and Covenants</em>" and
          the "<em>Pearl of Great Price</em>."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the LDS church today is a large organization accepted by
          mainstream society, it didn't start out like that. They had a couple
          of things against them, first was religious bigotry. Even if you slap
          a Jesus sticker on your new faith, it would be hard to gain acceptance
          in 1830. Even if the second great awakening had occurred, people were
          still skeptical about the millenarianism sects of which early
          Mormonism was a part. Millennialism is not a movement for 30-something
          who is bragging about when they had a walkman. No, it is a belief that
          paradise would be on earth, not heaven. Or the simple version of it,
          at least. The second thing working against Mormonism was that Smith
          didn't stop being a con artist just because he started to work for
          Jesus. His criminal records grew even when leading the church; he was
          mainly fond of banking frauds. But he was not afraid of planning
          murders on officials, treasons, inciting riots, and starting some of
          the Mormon wars.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A third thing creating friction for the Mormons was when Smith
          realized that people believed him. He started then to have more
          revelations, and suddenly he could sleep with everybody's daughters.
          He also added the idea of the gentiles and how they were inferior to
          the Mormons. So as you hear, they did a few things that, for quite
          apparent reasons, might create friction with the neighbors. Now the
          church will talk themselves silly about the first part. But they are
          evasive about the other two, almost actively trying to suppress this
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joseph Smith also believed that Zion would be a place in the US. In
          1930 Smith had a revelation that said that the Second Coming of Jesus
          Christ would take part in Independence, Missouri. It is a town most
          notable for being a pitstop for Lewis and Clark on their travels and
          the Donner party. At first, the Mormons' arrival to the city was
          peaceful, but tensions grew due to the reasons we brought up earlier.
          They got expelled in 1833 but stayed in the area, culminating with the
          first Mormon war in 1838. Smith learned from his mistakes and, in
          1844, gave Zion a more fluent location: "<em
            >The whole of America is Zion itself from north to south, and is
            described by the Prophets, who declare that it is the Zion where the
            mountain of the Lord should be, and that it should be in the center
            of the land.</em
          >" Without a fixed point, the church could leave Independence behind
          and find a new Zion again.

          After being hounded out of Independence, Smith found a new town at the
          eastern border of Illinois called Venus (before that, Quashquema),
          which had begun as a settlement of the indigenous Americans. Due to
          the church's number, they could take over the town and, through
          democratic means, seize the political offices in 1839. Smith was
          elected mayor, and the town's name was changed to Nauvoo. Nauvoo comes
          from the Hebrew word Navu meaning beautiful. This is a reference to
          Jesaja 52:7, so Smith could say that this was a part of the new
          Zion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The downfall and death of Smith started with a newspaper called Nauvoo
          Expositor. When you know that this paper leads to Smith's end, you
          might expect a Guardian-level operation. But in fact, it only
          published one issue on June 7, 1844. Nauvoo Expositor was created by
          former church members and contained criticism of Joseph Smith's
          doctrines. Smith did not like this and decided to go on the offense.
          So the publicists were ordered to be arrested, and a trial was held
          between the 8th and 10th of June. The paper was deemed to be a public
          nuisance and ordered annihilated. A posse of some 100 people burned
          the building to the ground.&nbsp;

          One publicist named Francis M. Higbee sent out a letter trying to get
          help from the state. The news about the newspaper's destiny spread,
          and papers published the statement across the state. Fearing a
          rebellion, Smith declared martial law on June 18 and called in the
          local militia of 5000 men. Fearing civil war Governor Ford ordered
          Smith arrested and rounded up a posse. Smith fled to Iowa but would
          later surrender on June 25.

        <p>
          Smith died on June 27, 1844, but the circumstances are a bit foggy.
          The official church position is that a mob fueled by religious bigotry
          stormed in and slew Joseph Smith. He was shot in the back and tumbled
          out of a window, trying to escape. On the other side, we have the
          successor Brigham Young staging the event with a portion of the Mormon
          army to get rid of Smith. We might never learn the answer, but we know
          that Young would take on the role of the new charismatic leader of the
          faith. Under this new regime, the Mormons would continue their pursuit
          of their Zion and later find it in Utah. We will look into what
          happened there a little bit later. Young did institute an oath of
          vengeance as a part of the endowment into the church. This oath to
          take revenge on the US was not removed until 1930. For the annals, I
          just want to say that this is in no way a thorough retelling of Smith
          and LDS history. It's long and even more ludicrous than I've managed
          to cover here.

        <h4 id="starcluster">
          Star clusters and the Jehovah's Witnesses&nbsp;
        </h4>
        <p>
          But let's return to our TV show here. So they've mentioned that Smith
          got the plates from an angel called Moroni. Since angels come down
          from heaven, Smith must be talking about an alien. We then have Logan
          Hawk, who says:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Moroni claimed to be from the Pleiades star cluster. So, a church
            today, nine million members strong, believes that their church may
            have originated not of this world, but of another world.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue here is that Hawk is blending two cults, the Jehovah's
          Witnesses and the Mormons. The JW squad does have an idea that god is
          located within the Pleiades. This was due to an early widespread
          notion during 1800 that the Pleiades was the center of the universe.
          As for the Angel Moroni, the name was not used for the Angel who
          visited Smith until 1835. In preparation for "<em
            >Doctrine and Covenants,"</em
          >
          Smith named the Angel Moroni, who would be the spiritual version of
          the prophet Moroni. Moroni was the last person to inscribe the golden
          tablets; he was a human on earth, to be precise. But the name was
          later changed by Smith to Nephi, the first translator of the tablets.
          But the church later considered it a mistake and changed the name to
          Moroni again after Smith's death.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we look into the Mormon doctrines, we find the book of Abraham in
          which Smith asserted there was a star/planet named Kolob. Kolob was
          presumed to be near the throne of god and a representation of the
          first creation. So Logan Hawk has cherry-picked the things he liked
          and then put them together, hoping nobody would notice.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="moundbuilder">Mound builder myth</h4>
        <p>
          They then say that the tablets were found in Cumorah Hill, but it's
          important to note that Cumorah Hill is not a mound or manufactured
          structure. The hill's name is an invention of Smith and was
          unimportant to the local population before this. But Coppens comes in
          with this quite interesting quote:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"We have since found out that in burial mounds and other mounds
            across the Native American region we have such plates. These written
            tables have been found, and not just in North America, but also in
            South America. This entity tells Joseph Smith to go on a physical
            search for an object, which we know could have been an archeological
            finding."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>The narrator continues:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"According to Ancient Astronaut Theorists, Moroni may, in fact,
            have been a Star Being &ndash; an extraterrestrial whose mission was
            to pass down to Smith and his followers the advanced knowledge of
            the mound builders."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Smith probably "found" the tablets in the hill, or mound as he calls
          it, so he can hint at the myth about moundbuilders. As settlers moved
          west, they started encountering mounds and earthworks that we
          attribute to the Adena culture today. But to the 19th-century minds,
          the mounds were too advanced to have been built by the indigenous
          people. The idea about the moundbuilders had started to appear, an
          "evolved" race that had been lost to time. Several different
          hypotheses circulated on who the builders were. Maybe it was
          Egyptians, an enclave of welsh people, a settlement of Norwegians, or
          perhaps it was a lost tribe of Israel. Basically, anything other than
          the native Americans who had been living in these lands for
          generations. For example, JW Foster, the president of Chicago the
          academy of science, reasoned that native Americans "/../
          <em
            >was never known to engage in an enterprise requiring methodical
            labor; he dwells in temporary and movable habitations. /&hellip;/ To
            suppose that such a race threw up the strong lines of
            circumvallation and the symmetrical mounds wich crown so many of our
            river-terraces is preposterous, almost, as to suppose they built the
            pyramids of Egypt."</em
          >
          note that this quote is from 1887 from one of the leading scientists
          of the time. As we said with Serpent mound in the last episode, the
          day's science was not above racist ideas.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There were more claims to support the myth about the mound builders.
          Another was that there had been finds of metal objects in the mound.
          It is correct that the indigenous people of North America never got
          too far in metallurgy. So the presence of metallic artifacts in the
          mounds was evidence that it must have been someone else. But when
          these objects were re-examined, the metal objects were of native
          copper. Copper is one of those metals that you can find raw in nature.
          This is why most metalworking cultures have started with copper; you
          can call it a gateway metal. That the pure copper is easily worked is
          just a bonus, and we have some beautiful artifacts preserved to our
          days. It is not as if they found some stainless steel or Oneida
          silverware in the mounds.

        <p>
          Another argument in favor of the moundbuilders being another more
          advanced race was that there were tablets with alphabetic letters in
          the mounds. Some were misinterpretations of archeological finds, but
          some were pure hoaxes. The earliest is probably the Grave Creek
          Tablet, found in 1838. The signs have been attributed to greek, Norse,
          or Phoenician. But no one has been able to determine if the author
          tried to relay a message or just scribbled random signs on it. We can
          also count Smith's tablets among these hoaxes, even if we have not
          seen any evidence of them existing.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we also have the Key-stone, a small arrow or cheese slicer formed
          stone inscribed with Hebrew letters reading "<em
            >the laws of Jehova</em
          >," "<em>the word of the Lord</em>," "<em>the holy of holies</em>,"
          and "<em>the king of the earth</em>." Another stone called Decalogue
          with the ten commandments was also found, written in Hebrew but
          strangely in a different accent. If they were lost tribes of Israel,
          it's hard to believe they would use two versions of the script tied to
          varying times in Israel. What makes it stranger is that some
          grammatical parts indicate they were written in 1800. So both of these
          can be reasonably called frauds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, we have the Davenport tablets found while excavating
          mounds in Davenport, Iowa. These are crude forgeries with something
          that is supposed to resemble languages and planetary movement. But
          since they used tiles from a local house to produce this fraud, we are
          confident these are bad forgeries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tablets have been found in native American mounds that aren't
          forgeries and hoaxes. They are commonly called the Adena tablets and
          are several tablets found especially in mounds. The problem for us is
          that only two were found by archeologists; the rest were found by
          treasure hunters. Looking at the patterns, design, and where these
          tablets were located, archeologists are pretty sure that the tablets
          are associated with the Adena culture. They are modest in size; you
          will be able to hold one in your hand.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, these plates were not really meant to be read. While
          analyzed, it's become evident that they were meant to be utilized as
          stamps. Within the tablets' groves are traces of red ochre, animal
          fat, water, and in some cases, urine. These components would have made
          a relatively efficient color for printing. We always have, as a
          species, tried to decorate our belongings and make out self more
          stunning. So I don't think this is a far leap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most considerable effort to disprove the moundbuilder myth was
          made by Cyrus Thomas in 1882. Armed with 5000 dollars, he went through
          the evidence wonderfully academically. This resulted in a 700-page
          report in 1894 called "<em
            >Report on the mound explorations of the Bureau of Ethnology</em
          >," where he laid out things we discussed. Even if most of us have
          come a long way since early 19th-century archaeology, these ideas
          remain as we see in the show. I do not know if Coppens meant the
          tablets with or without the letters, but it's clear he was talking
          about the moundbuilders. Our friend Graham Hancock did revisit this
          myth in a new form with Atlantis mixed into this as late as 2019. The
          book is called "<em
            >America Before: The Key to Earth's Lost Civilization</em
          >," but if I were you, I'd stay away from it. If you want to explore
          this subject more, I would instead turn to Jason Colavito's book "<em
            >The Mound Builder Myth: Fake History and the Hunt for a "Lost White
            Race</em
          >." You find a deep excavation of the moundbuilder myth there, and I
          highly recommend the book.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="lamanites">Lamanites&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          But what do the moundbuilders have to do with Joseph Smith? As we
          mentioned earlier, part of this myth told about lost tribes of Israel
          coming to America and building these mounds. This idea also appears in
          Joseph Smith's writing, and in "<em>Book of Mormon</em>," Smith talks
          about how white Israelis who believed in Jesus traveled across the sea
          to the new world. They were called Nephites, but some turned wicked
          and rebellious. These evil people called themself Lamanites, and their
          wrongful living turned their skin dark. Smith wrote in the 2 Nephi
          fifth chapter:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore
            cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened
            their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint;
            wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome,
            that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did
            cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to Ham's story, the difference is that the Lamanites did more
          than see their drunk-ass father naked. Hams' skin does not turn black
          in this story, but this passage was often used in the colonial period
          to justify slavery. Though this passage was probably an inspiration
          for Smith. The Mormons did believe that their whiteness was a divine
          sign of them being the chosen people; their whiteness was what set
          them apart from the darker tainted people. It was even a foundation
          for priesthood within the church. In 1844 Brigham Young clarified that
          being of Abraham's pure and unmixed seed was essential to be
          considered for the priesthood. With the seed of Abraham, Brigham Young
          meant that you were white.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Young would continue to use the Ham passage to justify that cursed
          people can't hold the priesthood; by cursed, he meant black. He
          cleared this in a speech in 1852, cementing the church's view on the
          matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Lord told Cain that he should not receive the priesthood nor his
            seed, until the last of the posterity of Able had received the
            priesthood, until the redemption of the earth. If there never was a
            prophet, or apostle of Jesus Christ spoke it before, I tell you,
            this people that are commonly called negroes are the children of old
            Cain. I know they are, I know that they cannot bear rule in the
            priesthood, for the curse on them, until the residue of the
            posterity of Michael and his wife receive the blessings, the seed of
            Cain would have received had they not been cursed."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea was in effect until the 1970s, and the passage about the
          amenities in later editions changed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But due to this Lamanite connection, the indigenous people had a
          paradoxical relation to the early Mormons. They were doomed to be
          looked at as inferior, but according to the book of Mormon prophecies,
          they had the capabilities to become superior. A direct descendant of
          the Nephites, cursed, but curses can be broken. The Mormon church
          believed that the Native Americans, if properly converted, could again
          become white. This idea led to Mormons taking in children from native
          American families, not all voluntary, to be servants. Later in the
          previous century, it changed to give proper education, as they call
          it. All of it to make "white people" out of them. This "education"
          program was active up until the 1970 or 1980s in some areas.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We explored the history of appropriation of the native American
          culture last episode. The LDS have not been innocent of this either.
          For example, in early meetings, they often talked in tounges imitating
          a made-up version of Native American languages, and chanted and danced
          "just like Indians." These are just a few examples of how the Mormons
          under Smith and later church leaders have incorporated real and
          fictional native American elements into their teachings.&nbsp;

        <h4 id="wakara">Wakara, massakers and wars</h4>
        <p>
          Now when we have a better understanding of the foundation of the LDS
          church, we will move on to the Mormons' entry into Utah.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Joseph Smith felt such a strong connection to the Native Americans
            that he believed they could help guide him to a new holy land, which
            he called "the new Zion." Although Smith died in 1844, the victim of
            mob violence &ndash; his successor, Brigham Young, ultimately led
            the Mormons further west to Utah. In 1849, when the Mormons arrived
            in the area of Parowan Gap, local Ute leader, Chief Wakara, told
            them they had entered "God's own house" and showed them proof in the
            form of petroglyphs dating back thousands of years.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We have covered Smith's idea about the new Zion already, and Utah was
          a logical place due to not yet being part of the US. Utah would become
          a territory in 1850, and it would not be until 1896 that it would
          become a state. The Mormons settled early in 1849 with the skeptical
          approval of the local leaders. The Native Americans in the area did
          call themselves the "Niche" or "The people," then they were divided
          into smaller bands such as "Fish eaters" and "Lake people." But the
          identity was fleeting, and a family cluster could change bands over
          time. It was not as in Europe, where we identify with our place of
          birth.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Allowing the Mormons to settle was a form of protection against the
          US's attempts to get the indigenous people off the lands. But
          relations did turn sour rather quickly; just during 1849, the Mormons
          committed two massagers, killing some 100 native Americans. From this
          point, the relationships between different bands and the Mormons were
          fleeting and mostly forged out of necessity. Chief Wakara did take
          advantage of this; being quite a character, he tried to use the
          Mormons to his advantage as much as possible. This gave him numerous
          names among the anglo-American settlers, such as "Napoleon of the
          dessert" or "Indian land pirate." Showing their admiration and
          contempt at the same time in their names.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Wakara did have some 150 people in his band, but the individuals
          changed over time. What set Wakara apart was his approach to nomadism
          and horses. While the other people in Utah were sedimentary, Wakara
          was in motion. If he saw an opportunity to get ahead, he took it; this
          made him neither friend nor foe to the Mormons. Wakara seems to have
          been a complicated person. This did not fit well with the white
          Mormon's ideal of the indigenous people. After the chief's death, they
          wrote him as a more simplistic character. Since the native Americans
          were supposed to be aggressors, they even made up stories on how
          Wakara, in 1950, tried to attack Fort Provo but instead had his band
          howl in the night.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mormons even staged reenactments of "Indian attacks" during
          festivities, where they dressed up as Native Americans and pretended
          to attack the celebrations. This would later be picked up by Buffalo
          Bill and his shows. The dressing up as native Americans was not
          limited to only pretend attacks. It was also used in the Mountain
          Meadows Massacre, where they dressed up and attacked the Banker-Fisher
          wagon train heading for California. They killed some 140 people but
          spared children young enough to not remember the events. Those were
          given to local families to raise as Mormons.

          As for the petroglyphs, the quote can be traced to an expedition led
          by the LDS-member Parley P. Pratt. Since Wakara had directed them to
          the site of Parowan Gap petroglyphs, it could be well argued that he
          tried to elucidate that this was a holy site in a way these settlers
          would comprehend. While Christians see the place of god as a building,
          many other religions tend to have the gods around them. I'm not sure
          why the show focuses on the quote; it seems as if someone is trying to
          describe their culture to an outsider.
        </p>
        <h3 id="starbeings">Star Beings</h3>
        <p>
          Tsoukalos then starts talking about petroglyphs, and the show presents
          a sample. Some are from the area, others unknown places; the show
          wants us to believe they are all from the same site. We bring this up
          since any strange petroglyph to Tsoukalos will mean it's an alien. As
          we've mentioned, they see what they want to see in these cases. But we
          use this to launch ourselves into the next section. Star Beings,
          ancestors, people, or children, these beings come with numerous names
          and in diverse forms. We've encountered them before, and we will try
          to explore them a bit more in this section. Now the show wants us to
          connect the star people with the Mormon angel Moroni and the Lumeleys
          UFO crash described by the Weird Wild West author Josh Walen as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"In 1865 [October 19, editors note], the Missouri Democrat reported
            that a trapper saw the light traveling through the sky at night. It
            flew over his camp, broke apart, and crashed in the forest some
            miles away. The next day he tracked it down and found a large stone
            embedded in the side of a mountain. It was hollow; it was cracked
            open; he claimed there were chambers inside of it, and there were
            hieroglyphic markings on it. And there was also some mysterious
            liquid spilled around the area. But the newspaper, you know, went so
            far as to suggest that these were meteoric conveyances of aliens
            from Mercury or Uranus. So, the whole idea of UFO crashes was
            explored in the 19th century almost a hundred years before
            Roswell."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Complete with Egyptian hieroglyphs, it sounds like an invention of its
          time. I've not been able to find the original article itself, but we
          must remember that newspapers of the day had a different approach than
          many in our time. Even today, we struggle with misinformation, and as
          we explored in the last episode about the Aurora crash, they were not
          above printing internal jokes as news.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="abovepeople">Above people and Zitkala-Za</h4>
        <p>
          But with this story, we get a brief presentation about the Sky beings
          by Andrew Collins. He tells us that the Blackfoot tribe has a
          tradition where beings come down from the sky in "Sky vehicles."
          Nowhere in the literature could I find references to vehicles, but we
          have to remember that myths can evolve over time, so Mr. Collings
          might have heard a newer version where wagons had been
          incorporated.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          But it is true that among the Blackfoot people and other tribes, there
          is an idea about the Above People (Sky beings). The main characters we
          might encounter are the Sun, the Moon, the Morningstar, and the
          Star-boy.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In the story of the Star Boy, he and his mother are thrown down from
          the sky world due to the mother's disobedience. The boy or Poia is
          marked with a terrible scar and can't marry. Poia embarks on a long
          journey to meet the Sun and get his forgiveness. The Sun does forgive
          Poia and returns him to earth where the scar is gone and is bestowed
          with the sacred knowledge of the Sun Dance.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the above people or sky beings have a place among Native American
          cultures. But to call these aliens is to reduce a complex and living
          culture, not that this has stopped the ancient alien crowd. We know
          they do this with all religions to some extent. But with the beliefs
          of the native Americans, they've taken more narrative freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then meet Standing Elk from the Yankton Dakota Tribe, part of the
          Sioux People. The Dakota people share some ideas with the Blackfoot,
          such as Sun-dances and star men. Tikal-Za was a Yankton Dakota woman
          known for her writings, musical talent, and political activism. She
          wrote a few of these stories in her book "<em>Old Indian Legends</em>"
          in 1901. Tikal-Za is quite the character; she wrote an opera and
          championed Native American rights. I would happily talk more about
          her, but I'll add some links to her essays in the show notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why Standing-Elk (or Loren Zephier), who was a chief among the
          Yankton Dakota tribe and a Sun-dance chief, was not the one retelling
          the story about the sky beings is a bit odd. However, Standing-Elk
          appears on the show to talk about how he was visited by
          extraterrestrial beings. He did write about all of this in his book
          "<em
            >Maka Wicahpi Wicohan: Universal and Spiritual Laws of Creation</em
          >" and is a frequent flyer among UFO- and new age events.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This was basically everything we got on the Above People. Quite
          disappointing, to be honest; most of it focused on the white
          experience rather than having a native American perspective. We're not
          done yet, and we will see more about just that in the next section.
        </p>
        <h3 id="thunderbird">Thunderbirds</h3>
        <p>
          We are going to Tombstone, Arizona, and the narrator starts to talk
          about Wyat Earp and OK Corral, but we're not going to talk about them.
          Why bring up Wyat Earp and OK Corral if you will not use them?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show talks about two cowboys who saw a giant creature in the sky,
          looking like an alligator with wings out of membrane. We then hear how
          the story has grown into different versions, changing until the
          creature is bulletproof. The show is alluding to an article in the
          Tombstone Epitaph published on April 26, 1890. In this article, the
          cowboys are two ranchers returning home; they spot the creature who
          seems exhausted on the ground at first. When they get closer, it flies
          up and away a little bit but returns to earth. After a few more
          flights, the creature turns against the two ranchers, who easily stay
          out of its way and shoot at it. After a few shots, the beast is
          unmovable on the ground. The creature was 92 feet (28 m) long, and the
          head was 8 (2,5 m) feet with giant teeth. The wingspan was a whopping
          192 feet (58 m), but it only had two little paws.&nbsp;

          If you look into this story, you note it's only one article, but it
          has evolved over the years. Some claim it was in 1886 and a second in
          1890; some photos are circulating, but these are known hoaxes. But the
          show's idea that this is some sort of spacecraft is clearly not.

          Tsoukalos then talks about the tommyknockers and ghost riders, and
          ghost trains. He wonders if these were campfire stories invented on
          the spot or built on actual events. I'm not sure what method Tsoukalos
          uses to differentiate between fiction and non-fiction, but it needs
          some tweaking. From his writing and speaking on the show, it feels as
          if it comes down to "if it benefits me, this legend is real."
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, we talk about Transcendentalism, science fiction, and
          poetry. Michel J Crow gives us this quote:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Transcendentalism was perhaps the leading philosophy developed in
            America in the 19th century. One of the founding figures in it was
            Ralph Waldo Emerson. It was his belief in extraterrestrial life that
            led him to depart from Christianity, and another author who is part
            of that is the poet Walt Whitman. His most famous book, 1855, was
            "The Leaves of Grass." And in "The Leaves of Grass," there are like
            200 references to astronomy. He believed strongly in
            extraterrestrials."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Transcendentalism was popular in America since it is a highly American
          philosophy. It talks about the natural goodness in people, how society
          and government have corrupted them, and that people can only be their
          best if self-reliant. But Walt Whitman was not a pure
          transcendentalist, he incorporates parts of it in his poetry, but
          you'll find a lot of realism there too. He moved between these two
          movements during his life and writings. As for the poetry collection
          they mention, I found two references to astronomy there. If you count
          things like the sun, moon, stars, sky, and something that can be found
          above your head. Sure, you might end up at 200, but I'm not sure where
          Crow gets this idea. Neither do I get ET vibes from the collections. I
          think they would need to point out some more specific poems. Whitman
          was known to speak his mind, and I can't find that he conveyed
          anything about beings from space. To get a feeling of what Whitman
          wrote the poem you can read the poem "Going somewhere" here:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;My science-friend, my noblest woman-friend,&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;(Now buried in an English grave&mdash;and this a memory-leaf for
          her dear sake,)&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Ended our talk&mdash;&ldquo;The sum, concluding all we know of
          old or modern learning, intuitions deep,&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&ldquo;Of all Geologies&mdash;Histories&mdash;of all
          Astronomy&mdash;of Evolution, Metaphysics all,&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&ldquo;Is, that we all are onward, onward, speeding slowly,
          surely bettering,&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&ldquo;Life, life an endless march, an endless army, (no halt,
          but it is duly over,)&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&ldquo;The world, the race, the soul&mdash;in space and time the
          universes,&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&ldquo;All bound as is befitting each&mdash;all surely going
          somewhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But from poetry, we move toward early Science Fiction; you might, when
          hearing this, have several American authors pop up. But you are all
          wrong except if you thought about Ambrose Bierce. Born in 1842, he was
          a Civil War Veteran of the Union Army, writer, and journalist. He may
          be most known for his book "the devils' dictionary," which could be
          described as an early "Urban Dictionary." The book contains some 100
          words with satirical definitions and is by many thought of as one of
          the American masterpieces. Bierce was considered one of the most
          influential journalists in the USA and worked until his end. If you
          might have read a story by him, it's most likely "<em
            >An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge</em
          >," written as a stream of consciousness with a famous twist ending I
          won't give away here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 10px">
          <img

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">

        </figure>
        <p>
          Even if Bierce dabbles with some early Sci-Fi, this is not really what
          he's most famous for. Nor is his story "The Difficulty of Crossing a
          Field" first published in the San Francisco Examiner on October 14,
          1888. Logan Hawk gives the story spark notes but adds things that are
          not there. For example, he claims that the wife says she can hear the
          husband's voice from a circle that was left in the field. But this is
          Hawk's own addition. I'm not against that a fictional story expands
          and is rewritten by the narrator. But you can't add things to a
          fictional story and then say that the story with the additions is
          true. But we see this quite often with the Ancient Alien theorists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to time reasons, I'll not retell the story here, but I'll narrate
          the original story from 1888 in a little bonus episode if you want to
          hear more. As usual, you will find it in the show notes connected to
          this episode on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not know precisely how Ambrose died, but the show has a few
          ideas. Childress suspects that the journalist maybe got himself into a
          mystical portal:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"At the very early part of 20th-century, Ambrose Bierce was in
            Northern Mexico, in this area that's known for strange phenomenon,
            called Paquime, this area too is thought to be another one these
            interdimensional portal areas."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Logan Hawks think that maybe Bierce met up with F.A Mitchell-Hedges.
          Yes, that Mitchell-Hedges, the one famous for the "Crystal Scull." The
          idea is that they meet up in Paquime to go to the largest Crystal Cave
          in the world to communicate with the scull. They figured out the
          language and unlocked an interdimensional portal that brought Bierce
          to the Extra Terrestrials.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The then 71-year-old Bierce was indeed in Chihuahua City in 1913. This
          creates a few problems for the Mitchell-Hedges connection since,
          according to them, it was found in 1924 in Belize. The crystal cave
          Hawks mentions had a small part discovered in 1910, but the main
          feature that would make it the largest in the world would not be found
          until 2000.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1913 Ambrose Bierce set out on a tour of Civil War Battlefields,
          but in El Paso, Texas, he decided it would be more interesting to
          follow Pancho Villas's army as an observer. We know he witnessed the
          Battle of Tierra Blanca and did continue with the military to
          Chihuahua City. The show then adds something that, in fact, happens.
          John Hafner explains:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"While there, he sent his last communication that we know of, which
            was a letter, and that letter ended with this ominous line: "As for
            me, I leave tomorrow for an unknown destination."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          After this letter, no more communication is known, and we do not know
          what happened. Investigations place Amboce in town, but witnesses do
          not know what ensued after. But would it be far-fetched that his age
          caught up, he got into the crossfire, or any other reason other than
          aliens? Some speculate that he committed suicide to avoid the effects
          of old health; others speculate that he got himself in front of a
          firing squad. We do have another among his last letters in which
          Bierce say&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Good-bye. If you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone
            wall and shot to rags, please know that I think it is a pretty good
            way to depart this life. It beats old age, disease, or falling down
            the cellar stairs. To be a Gringo in Mexico--ah, that is
            euthanasia!</em

        <p>
          To be genuine, I do not know what happened with Ambrose Bierce;
          hopefully, we might learn someday. But with everything about Ambrose,
          I think that aliens are the least likely explanation for his
          disappearance and a pretty boring one if it is true.&nbsp;

        <h3 id="devilslake">Devils Lake</h3>
        <p>
          From Paquime, we're steering northeast towards Los Angeles and
          Elizabeth Lake just west of Lancaster. The lake is almost 2,5
          kilometers long and sits on the San Andreas faultline, and most people
          would not think twice about this lake. But it is apparently hiding
          something monstrous under it. The show tells us that the lake's
          original name is "La Laguna de Diablo" or "The Devil's Lake" because
          the settlers in the area believed that a devil creature would rise
          from it. The name Devils lake was noted by the priest Junipero Serra
          in 1780. It would later switch to "La Laguna de Chico Lopez" due to
          rancher Mr. Lopez owning so much land in the area. The name Elizabeth
          it has today might stem from Elizabeth Clayton Clark. Her family
          started a trading post/restaurant by the lake, and she was so beloved
          by the clientele that when she died, the lake was renamed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lake has also served as a point to divide the territories of the
          tribes Serrano, Tataviam, and Kitanemuk. Unfortunately, the language
          of these indigenous people has died out, and in my research, I could
          not find what they called the lake. But the idea about the devil came
          from the European settlers in the area, not the Native American
          people.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then hear the story about how this creature was hassling the
          locals, rising from the water, and stealing cattle. The eyes shoot
          fire or lightning, and it has a tremendous sound. This story comes in
          a few different variations; the folklore likes to connect the rancher
          Lopez to the monster. The man responsible for getting rid of it in the
          lore is called Miguel Leonis. With his no-nonsense attitude, he
          grabbed his rifle and shot at the beast, who was immune to the bullets
          but fled. Some stories describe the monster as a dragon, some as a
          griffin, while others don't really identify the monster. But note that
          in all of these stories, they talk about a living creature with wings.
          Not some sort of steampunk UFO with wings.

        <p>
          I found an article from 1886 published in the Los Angeles Times, where
          they printed one version of the story. They start the article by
          taunting another paper for printing these reports, but the LA times
          have now gotten proof. The story might rival Nibelungenlied, but it's
          from a trustworthy man called Peter B. Simpson. The story has been
          around some time, but it seems as if it's not until later than this
          Lopez got connected to it. The news article contains most of the
          elements we hear in the story. It's written with a bit of tongue and
          cheek, so I'm not sure if this article was meant to be taken seriously
          or if it was a fun story for a lazy Sunday afternoon.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          They are trying to present the etymology of placenames with the name
          devil in them. We get a quote from Standing Elk, but I feel it's
          heavily taken out of context. Standing Elk claims that places, where
          mysterious things happened got the word devil associated with them.
          For example, he brings up Devil's Lake and the Devil's Tower. The fact
          that he brings up the Devil's Tower I consider to be a clear
          indication that they might have taken this out of context.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Devil's Tower is a butte that, among Native Americans, is known as
          different variations of "the bear's lodge" but is also known as "great
          grey horn" or "brown buffalo horn." This mountain there's a couple of
          holy stories associated with it and is viewed to this day as a sacred
          site.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have not really talked about the Thunderbird in Native American
          myths. This is primarily because the show has not brought it up,
          either. They talk about these peculiar folk legends told by settlers
          and loosely connect them to indigenous people to sell you the "Dragon
          theory." The Dragon theory is if it is flying and spitting thunder or
          fire, it must be a UFO they are describing with their primitive
          vocabulary.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue here is that there is not a "one" thunderbird. Most of the
          tribes on the Midwestern, Plains, and Northwest Coast have their
          version of the bird. Some elements match while others don't. Its size
          differs; among some, it's a sacred force of nature; among others, it's
          a powerful being but no more special than other animals. The show
          simplifies the tale so much that it's a new version. As we discussed
          last week, it's a form of plastic shamanism; they want to sell you the
          idea that native Americans have UFOs in their religion since they are
          more attuned to nature.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember to be careful about new-age-like claims about indigenous
          people since they are often wrong. We have seen this repeatedly in
          this episode and in previous episodes. If you give them a myth, they
          will change it until it fits. On that note, we will leave the wild
          west for now.
