          Is the Richat structure the location of the fabled city of Atlantis?
          According to Jimmy Corsetti, it might be the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Atlantis story may be one of the myths that have inspired numerous
          theories and speculations. But what happens if we apply a scientific
          approach to the story told by Plato in his works Timeaus and Critias?
          We open up the archaeologist's toolbox and a historical approach to
          the literary works of Plato. How does Plato's story hold up, and was
          he really trying to give us a literal account from a philosophical
          perspective?
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Atlantis story has inspired writers such as Graham Hancock
          and David Childress, a new name has recently gotten much attention.
          Jimmy Corsetti is one of these personalities who claim to have found
          the actual location of this legendary city. According to Corsetti, the
          location is a location called the Richat structure. Is this true? What
          evidence can we find for and against this, and how well does this
          theory hold up in the end?
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is episode 41, and I'm your host, Fredrik. This time we will dive
          deeply into the Atlantis lore and meet a new personality. I hope this
          is the Atlantis episode to end all future episodes, but I doubt this
          will be the case. But we will look into whether Plato was trying to
          tell a historical account of Atlantis or if he had a different
          agenda.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We will also review the claims made by Jimmy Corsetti, also known as
          "Brightinsight6" on YouTube, that a geological formation called the
          Richat structure is the location of Atlantis.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, here we go again. Atlantis, the story that never seems to go away,
          or maybe a more accurate description would be "the idea of a story
          that never goes away." Because that is, as we will learn, maybe one of
          the main issues with the story is that people are talking about their
          beliefs about what Plato wrote rather than what Plato actually
          wrote.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Because this is what Jimmy Corsetti and so many others before him have
          done if you're unfamiliar with Jimmy, he hosts a Youtube channel
          called BrightInsights6; note that the name will be a bait and switch.
          Jimmy has a degree in communication and has been working as a
          theft/fraud investigator. This work background may be ironic since he
          has fallen for Hancock and Randall Carlson's less-than-credible ideas.
          I'm unsure how Jimmy got into all this, but let's review his videos
          and see if we can get through and maybe even change some minds. Jimmy
          seems to be an intelligent person who has fallen for some wrong ideas.
          But enough about Corsetti for now, and let's see if there's any truth
          to Jimmy Corsetti's claims about the Richat Structure being the
          location of Atlantis.
        </p>

        <p>
          But where do we begin an investigation of a claim like this? The most
          obvious place would be to see if the account is credible. How would a
          historian or archaeologist approach this? First, we would see if there
          are any primary sources for this. What do we mean by a primary source,
          then? Shortly summarized, it could be described that this is an
          original account created during or immediately after an event. It can
          come in several different forms, shapes, and content, but often it's
          split up into two categories. The first is manuscripts, these are
          writings that were not intended for public print and are often
          handwritten, and if circulated, it was on a tiny scale. It's often
          things like letters and journals, but even a laundry list would end up
          in this section.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, we have published sources; these are intended for public
          consumption and have been circulated for people to read the content.
          Here we put news, documentation, debates, memoirs, or public addresses
          from the states. Something worth considering with these sources is
          that they have been edited and often have an agenda we must consider
          when reviewing them. That does not mean a manuscript is free from
          agendas, but they can be more raw since the author wrote them with a
          sense of privacy.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As an archaeologist, I'd be inadequate if I forgot to mention here
          that we also have artifacts and excavations that serve as primary
          sources. Excavation can also be noteworthy since it can corroborate
          what both primary and secondary sources are telling us.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We always want to use primary sources in research and when we want to
          learn how and why an event took place. This might not be possible for
          several reasons, but we can use secondary sources. These often include
          books, articles, essays, or other mediums. The difference is that
          these are not original accounts and usually have been selected from
          different sources to interrogate the past. Here it's also essential to
          try and see if the author mainly relies on primary or secondary
          sources. So for a book, a good rule of thumb is that the broader the
          book's scope, the more secondary sources the author has used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Robert Williams has a great example in his book "The Historians
          Toolbox," where he brought up The Wannsee Protocol. This account was
          documented by Adolf Eichmann during the Wannsee Conference in 1942 and
          discussed the Final Solution. We have the original document left from
          World War II stored in Germany. But this is an obvious example of a
          primary source. It was written by someone who attended the conference
          while it took place. A secondary source would be any book that uses
          this document to tell the history of the Holocaust. The secondary
          source uses the original to interpret an event and tell us about it
          within a context.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even if we have the source material right in front of us, there's
          a critical question we must ask ourselves. Something that will become
          clearer as we go. Any historian worth their salt must ask themselves
          what the document's purpose was. Why was it written? Why was it
          published? We need to have these questions in mind and then proceed
          with a good amount of skepticism toward the material.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how many primary sources do we have on Atlantis? The answer might
          shock you, but we have zero primary sources according to the
          abovementioned specifications. You might be surprised by this, but
          even Plato state that Critias the Older got the information from
          Dropides during a story competition. Dropides got it from Solon, who
          heard the story from an Egyptian priest. If we assume the events in
          Timaeus and Critias to be factual, there were no primary sources of
          the story. Some of you might object here, claiming there are other
          sources for Atlantis. I hear you, and I believe you are gabbing about
          Hellanicus of Lesbos's poem "Atlantis."
        </p>
        <p>
          While Hellanicus predates Plato by almost a hundred years, the poem is
          not about the fantastic city of Atlantis. The poem was found among the
          Oxyrhynchus Papyri, within volume 11, with designation 1359. This is a
          collection of papyri found at the turn of the previous century at
          what's known today as Al-Bahnasa. The poem is a literary work about
          the titan Atlas's daughters. You can read the translations and the
          original online; you don't have to take my word for it. So this poem
          is not of any help if you want to prove that the city of Atlantis
          exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some might now yell into the void that authors after Plato talk about
          Atlantis. That is, of course, true, but the thing they have in common
          is that they all refer to the same work by Plato. They don't add any
          other secondary or primary sources but essentially repeat what Plato
          wrote in Timaeus and Critias. So our only source is Plato, which is
          not a primary source. When it comes to the historical method, we want
          to see as many separate accounts as possible of an event. The more we
          have, the more likely it is to occurred. We would also want to see
          that the report is close in time, but according to Plato, it's 9000
          years between the event and the writing of it down. As we will see
          going forward, there's no archaeological evidence. So with the
          historical method in mind, the case for Atlantis looks bleak.
        </p>
        <h3 id="intent">Platos intent&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>
          Here we are with one single source or two if you want to define
          Timaeus and Critias as two accounts. I would not since the author and
          story are the same. We should now ask ourselves if Plato intended this
          to be a historical account, and here, I'd say there is a good case for
          it not being the case. Plato has never been much of a historian in his
          writings. While he used historical figures and events, they were often
          adapted to prove Plato's point. Something we saw, for example, in the
          case of Gyges ring in episode 39.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not only history Plato used in his writings to prove a point but
          also disciplines such as cosmology and the creation of man. I don't
          see Jimmy Corsetti or Hancock argue that the creation story in Timaeus
          is an accurate description. I don't really believe that Plato intended
          it to be taken as a literal description. He is using it to explain
          thoughts he brought up in the Republic. As I mentioned in episode 40,
          where we read the next book in the supposed trilogy, this takes place
          the evening after the dialogue in the Republic. If you read them
          carefully, Timaeus and Critias are filled with throwbacks to the
          Republic.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in The Republic, Socrates talks about the different
          sciences and how they are different. Socrates suggests a new way for
          mathematicians and astronomists to approach science to correctly grasp
          the principle and, ultimately, the greater good. By correcting the
          mistake of not forming a hypothesis and moving toward a dialectic
          approach, this science can evolve into a study of being itself. The
          whole idea of cosmology in Timaeus is to demonstrate that the highest
          form of principle is not only a principle of mere being but also a
          principle of coming into being. We learn that cosmology principles are
          fundamental in learning about the world we can see around us.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a spark note version of Plato's approach in Timaeus. If you
          are interested in this, I highly recommend reading Thomas Johansen's
          essay "The Timaeus on the Principles of Cosmology" or the book "Cosmos
          and Perception in Plato's Timaeus" by Mark Kalderon. As you might
          note, there's a lot more to this topic than I've covered now, but I'd
          argue that this is sufficient to demonstrate that this is not meant as
          a literal account. At the beginning of Critias, as we heard last time,
          Timeus even say, "I offer my prayer to the god who has just been
          created in my speech (though, of course, he was created long ago, in
          fact)." Hinting at the Greek story tradition where multiple accounts
          of the gods can exist and simultaneously be true for the sake of the
          story at hand.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So is the narrative in Critias to be taken as a literal historical
          account? Again we can find the answer by looking closely at the text;
          if we read the beginning of Timaeus carefully, we will see that
          Socrates is asking the attendees to place the perfect state of the
          Republic in a war against an equal foe. Socrates states, "That was
          why, once I'd delivered the account I'd been instructed to give, I
          gave you in your turn the assignment I'm now asking you to carry out."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is here Hermocrates claims that Critias just so happens to know a
          story that would fit the assignment at hand. So Critias tells the
          story about Atlantis as he heard it as a ten-year-old boy during a
          storytelling festival told by his then 90-year-old grandfather
          Critias, the Elder. Critias the Elder heard it from his father,
          Dropsides II, who in turn heard it from Solon, which Plato described
          as a friend and relative, even if this connection might be a bit
          dubious. Solon, in turn, heard it while in Egypt by a priest. We will
          return to Solon shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with all this in mind, it's hard to argue that Plato was serious
          about this being a literal account. Atlantis is a mere plot device,
          the evil empire to be bested by Socrates' perfect society. Plato lived
          in a society of stories, theater, and poetry; would it be strange to
          borrow from these art forms? He was someone who was quite masterful in
          the art of rhetoric. Why Plato is adding all these details into the
          story is to make different points and to give the bad guys a reason
          for their wickedness.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Take, for example, the difference between Athens and Atlantis from a
          geological perspective. Athens is made out of just Earth, a stable
          element that helps the city stay on course and endure. Compare this to
          Atlantis, where Poseidon mixes Earth and water, creating an unstable
          mixture. Do you remember Atlantis had two springs, one hot and one
          cold? Another hint is that Poseidon can't create the stability and
          balance of the far wiser Athena and Hephaestus. Athens only has one
          spring that has the same temperature all year round, and that keeps
          the balance in order.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also learn about the origin of their depravity; if you recall, in
          the previous episode, we learned that the downfall of Atlantis was the
          diluted blood. Note that a dilution can't happen if there's nothing
          there to dilute with, and of course, it's how Atlantis opened up to
          trade and let the foreigners in. As time went by, the spirit of
          Poseidon grew weaker, leaving room for imperialism and greed to grow.
          This is not a story about civilization but a warning of the issues
          Plato and probably other Athenians saw in their society today. Why
          spend the entirety of "the Republic," building this perfect society on
          paper when there was a historical example all along?
        </p>
        <p>
          So in a sense, there's no need to search for Atlantis since this was
          never a location Plato wrote about as a literal place. It was a
          thought experiment and fiction, not intended to be taken
          seriously.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="solon">What about Solon?</h3>
        <p>
          But what about Solon, the wise Sage who is the source, according to
          the text, of the account? Plato does use Solon to lend credibility to
          his story, the same with placing the origin in the written records of
          Ancient Egypt. However, this is a bit ironic, as we will note.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          From the start, there is an issue with Plato's description of Solon's
          journey to Egypt. Suppose you are familiar with the account of Solon
          provided by Herodutus. In that case, you know Solon traveled to Egypt
          after providing Athens with its laws. Solon took upon himself a
          journey where he traveled as a wise sage in his own right. This is
          specified in Histories, book one, chapter 29. But Plato has it the
          other way around; you see in Timeaus, we learned that Solon traveled
          to Egypt before creating the laws. In Plato's account, Solon is not
          yet the scholar he is destined to be, but is in need of a cure for his
          ignorance. Platos Solon even tries to impress the Egyptian priests
          with some knowledge of genealogy just to be corrected and learn of his
          ignorance.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Solon in Plato differs from other sources but shares many
          characteristics with another historical person Herodotus wrote about.
          In Histories, book two, chapter 143, we learn about Herodotus'
          predecessor, Hecataeus of Miletus. However, this is not a flattering
          account but rather a scathing story about the flaws in Hecataeus
          methods. Platos Solon seems to share the same journey and are using
          Hecataeus's methodology. Both the characters go to Egypt to find
          answers to their questions and are more or less described as students
          when doing this and making fools out of themselves.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that should maybe cause a bit of concern with someone
          familiar with the corpus of Plato is how the Egyptian priests are
          portrayed. The way the priests deconstruct the myths was criticized by
          Plato (or Socrates in Phaedrus, especially in chapter 229, where
          Socrates and Phaedrus discuss monsters and how they might look. Plato
          also writes in Timaeus that the Egyptian priests were reading from
          written records. Something that Plato in Phaedrus chapters 274e to
          275b scathingly criticizes. He states that writing is not for
          learning; it's merely for jogging memory and will not create knowledge
          from themselves. He writes, "You
        </p>
        <p>
          provide your students with the appearance of intelligence, not real
          intelligence." So reading about the priests with a deeper
          understanding of the body of work, the priests almost become symbols
          for a false appearance. So the priests should not be viewed as
          authority figures but as hints toward earlier lessons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plato doesn't want you to read texts to become vise; he wants you to
          learn through discussion and learning by listening. What we're told
          here are lessons on how not to learn history, according to Plato, and
          the real lesson is not learning the details but the meaning of the
          texts.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration for Atlantis</h3>
        <p>
          Some of you might sit there asking yourself, alright, so maybe it was
          not a literal account. But could Plato maybe have taken some
          inspiration from real civilization and just changed a few things? I'm
          not going to say that this is something impossible, but so far have,
          this approach had the same luck as the ones trying to find the
          location of Atlantis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Greeks were quite a young culture when they started expanding, and
          Plato knew this. The Greek civilization was young but still an
          excellent second to the great Egypt. So Plato would be well aware that
          there were other civilizations before Greece, and many of them met an
          end before Greece entered the scene. But for a civilization to be an
          inspiration, it must match the text to a great extent. Otherwise, we
          might have to classify those Hallmark movies "based on true events" as
          literal accounts.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The civilization most often suggested as an inspiration is the Minoan
          culture out of Crete. On the surface, it looks like it could be a
          match, but as usual, it all starts to fall apart when you look closer
          at the claim. That the origin of Atlantis could be the Minoans is not
          a new claim but dates back to the early 20th century.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1900 Sir Arthur Evans started to excavate on the island of Knossos
          with two forepersons and 32 workers. After just a few months, Evans
          had uncovered large parts of a palace he referred to as the Palace of
          Minos. With this initial discovery, the Minoan civilization had been
          discovered, and it was clear that it had been powerful. While the term
          palace might be a bit of a misnomer, a more accurate description might
          be that these are complexes with workshops, food processing, storage,
          and religious and civil administration.
        </p>
        <p>
          But just a few years after this discovery, an anonymous letter was
          sent to the British newspaper Times, which published it in 1909 titled
          "The Lost Continent." In this article, the anonymous author argues
          that the recently discovered palaces on Knossos were evidence that the
          Atlantis story originated within Mediterranean history and that the
          Minoan culture was Atlantis. This author would turn out to be
          historian K.T. Frost who 1913 published a paper in "The Journal of
          Hellenic Studies" expanding on the idea.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forwarding to 1939, a Greek archaeologist named Spyridon
          Marinatos suggested in an article in Antiquity that the eruption of
          the Vulcan Thera could be the cause for the Minoan's destructions. In
          the past, there had been suggestions that Atlantis' destruction was
          inspired by the Thera eruption. Marinatos would later combine the
          Thera eruption with Atlantis in an article he published in 1950.
          However, since it was written in Greek, it only got a little spread
          before being translated and republished in 1969. According to
          Marinatos, the Minoan culture's demise was tied to Thera's eruption.
          This collapse would have survived in the Greeks' minds and been the
          origin of the Atlantis story. This is similar to the ideas presented
          by Luis Figuer in 1872, except that Figuer did not have a culture to
          tie this idea to.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eruption of Thera was so significant that it would have affected
          the weather across Europe and maybe even as far as California. So this
          would have been a significant eruption similar to Mount Tamboras's
          explosion in 1815. The effects of this led to 1816 being called the
          year without a summer, creating agricultural disasters across the
          globe. Theras eruption would undoubtedly have affected the Minoan
          people since it occurred between 1639 and 1616 BCE based on datings
          performed by William Freidrich. The issue is not that it happened but
          that the Minoan culture existed for hundreds of years after. Most
          scholars today believe the collapse would have been around 1320 BCE.
          With this in mind, it's hard to argue that there is a clear connection
          between Atlantis's cataclysmic end and the Minoans.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In his book "Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries," Dr. Ken Feder points out
          that large chunks of the story must be altered to make the Minoan
          theory fit the description in Plato's script. Feder counted all
          testable archaeological accounts in Plato's writing and compared these
          to the Minoan culture. He could find six testable claims in Timeaus
          and 47 in Critias. Of these testable claims, 80% did not match Plato's
          description and the Minoan archaeological record. Only one is a
          precise match, and it's that Atlantis and Minoan complexes must have
          been a marvel to behold, but it's on the verge of being pointless, as
          Feder points out. Then some match with some special pleading and other
          cases where we just don't know.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So with all this in mind, does it really make sense to ask where
          Atlantis was located? According to Plato's teaching, it does not, and
          no credible evidence has been presented yet. Before we try to answer a
          question, we should ensure the question makes sense. But we have spent
          quite some time not dealing with Corsetti's ideas that he presents in
          his YouTube videos. So let's see what he has to offer.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="Corsetti">The Jimmy Corsetti Mistake&nbsp;</h3>
        <div class="video-container">

        <p>
          As we have seen, claiming to have found the location of Atlantis is to
          miss the point of a bit of Plato's story. But Jimmy Corsetti claims to
          have found what he believes is Atlantis's actual location, the&nbsp;
          Richat Structure. The issue is that you can throw a dart on a world
          map. Wherever it lands, the likelihood of someone claiming it to be
          the location of Atlantis is quite significant. People have suggested
          places all over the world to be the inspiration or location of
          Atlantis. My favorite claims are Olaus Rudbeck, who 1679 suggested
          Gamla Uppsala in Sweden be Atlantis. We also have a Finnish tour guide
          or excentric Ior Bock, who claimed Atlantis to be in Finland.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Just because there are numerous claims of Atlanti's location, this
          does not invalidate Corsetti's claims. But it does raise a bit of a
          red flag when we encounter these types of claims. Suppose Sweden,
          Bahamas, Malta, America, and India are possible locations. In that
          case, something is a bit off since they are so incredibly
          different.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To be fair, Corsetti did not come up with this idea; he repeats claims
          by George S. Alexander and Natalis Rosen made in their 2018
          documentary "Visiting Atlantis." I went with Corsetti's video because
          it's publicly available on YouTube and has a more extensive
          spread.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jimmy Corsetti is also influenced by Graham Hancock and Randall
          Carlson, spending quite some time linking Atlantis with the Younger
          Dryas Impact idea. We have yet to deal with YDI, but it will happen
          later when I solve some things. But even if the event were true, it
          would not change much. We have a lot of data from the period and know
          that chance of an advanced society matching Plato's description during
          this time is slim to none. But yes, we can't shake the ghost of
          Hancock of us yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's look at the claims themselves. Corsetti claims that the
          Richat Structure is a good fit because it has concentric rings. This
          is true; the formation that consists of an eroded dome has sedimentary
          rock visible that looks like rings. We know quite a lot of the site's
          geology that has been known since at least the 1940s. The dome was
          what I can find first described in a journal by the Frenchman
          Richard-Molard in 1948. Later the French naturalist Th&eacute;odore
          Monod launched an expedition in the 1950s resulting in further
          publications on the area. In the beginning, the Richat Dome was often
          referred to as Rich&acirc;t Crater; for some time, there was an idea
          that it was formed by a meteoric impact.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We today know a lot about how the structure was formed. In 2005, for
          example, Matton et al. published a paper clearly demonstrating the
          formation of the dome and the geological processes involved. Now I'm
          not a geologist, and I'm sure I'd butcher an explanation of the
          processes for hydrothermal infill and magmatism in the structure and
          how hydrothermal fluidization caused dissolving in the dome. The
          structure has been dated with Argon dating to be formed around 98.2
          &plusmn; 2.6 million years ago.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But say the least, we know quite a bit about the geological process in
          the area. All this makes Corsetti's statement that "In fact, the
          Richat structure wasn't even discovered until the Gemini 4 mission in
          1965, and is now a common landmark utilized by astronauts." a bit odd,
          to say the least. Since Jimmy Corsetti doesn't give his sources for
          the video, I can't say where he got this. I can only tell you that
          this is entirely wrong. Something that makes his explanation of the
          formation even weirder because he gets the process almost correct.
          Except he says that this can't be proven. I suspect that Corsetti has
          not read any of the studies on the dome but repeats secondary sources
          that leave information out&mdash;showing us that we can all be victims
          of fraud and the importance of checking the sources and asking experts
          for their input.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Is there more evidence that fits Plato's narrative? Well, according to
          Corsetti, it seems to be the case. "It just so happens that the
          diameter of its outer circle is approximately 23.5 kilometers, or 14.5
          miles, which is basically equivalent to the size and dimensions
          provided by Plato when converting from stadia to modern measurements.
          For example, the circular island of Atlantis was described as being
          127 stadia."
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not sure what translation Corsetti using. Still, from my
          translations, I get the following measurements, The first ring of
          water is three stadia. We have the first landmass, that's also three,
          then we have the second ring of water and land that are two stadia
          each. The third ring of water is one stadia wide, and the inner
          island's diameter is five stadia. So counting from the first ring of
          land, we have a diameter of 21 stadia; if we include the first ring of
          water, we get 27 stadia. Translating this to metrics, we have 4,2
          kilometers or roughly 2,6 miles. This is not near the claim made by
          Corsetti; again, I can't find where he might have gotten it. I assume
          the Atlantis documentary, but everything written about it leads back
          to his video. At least we can now put this claim to rest since it does
          not match the only source we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to appear as someone who nitpicks, so I'll gloss over the
          mountain range Corsetti matches Plato's description since it does not
          matter. We can find mountains all over that would be able to match.
          The same with the inlet; we are told that there is what could be
          described as an inlet to the south. But looking at a map, the part
          pointed out is a bit more to the southwest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="sealevel">Sea levels, land rise, and geography</h3>
        <p>
          There are a couple of obvious things that disqualify the Richat Dome
          as the site of Atlantis that we have not discussed yet. First of all,
          Plato gives us the island's location in his texts, outside the pillars
          of Heracles. This is what Greeks called the straight of Gibraltar, and
          the origin of the name comes from the tenth labor Heracles performed
          when he went as far west as possible. The Richat structure lies far
          south of Gibraltar, obviously not outside of it in any sense. Would
          not the Egyptians, Solon, and even Plato have been able to say south
          instead of hinting west? It's pretty strange that these people who are
          supposed to be the wisest of them all get simple cardinal points
          wrong. Corsetti also quotes Plato, who, according to Jimmy, tells us
          that Atlantis is now landlocked. I have no idea what translation
          Corsetti is working from. In the ones I've read, the quote is, "though
          by now earthquakes have caused it to sink and it has left behind
          unnavigable mud, which obstructs those who sail there." I would argue
          that it's hard to sail thru sand; note that Plato claims it's possible
          to sail in the area but hard to navigate through.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, this geological feature is 500 kilometers or more than
          310 miles from the nearest coastline. It's an understatement to say
          the formation is heavily landlocked, but it's not been close to the
          ocean at any point in history. But Corsetti claims something rather
          strange here "And something else we should consider is that the sands
          of the Sahara actually originate from the sea, an interesting fact
          that many people are not aware of." So Corsettis idea, or whoever he
          got this from, is that the sand in Sahara must have been created by
          the ocean. This a strange statement for several reasons, maybe most
          obviously since we know quite a deal about how deserts form and the
          Sahara is not the result of land being underwater. While the Saharas
          ecosystem looked different in the past, it's never been underwater.
          Still, neither has it always been a desert. But it was formed by
          extreme temperature shifts during the night and day that break the
          rocks. Add the lack of rain and erosion of the topsoil combined with
          saltation, a process where winds carry more minor pieces of sand and
          create sand dunes. The process might vary slightly depending on what
          desert we're looking at. Still, as for the Sahara, this would be the
          primary process.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While the seawater might not have reached the Richat Structure, a
          large river once flowed through the Sahara. In 2019, O'hara et al.
          published a paper describing the Trans-Saharan Seaway. This was a
          large river flowing from the middle of what we know today as Algeria,
          down through east Mali, and then exiting in east Nigeria and around
          Benin. This seaway was almost 50 meters deep in some places and
          contained a wide array of sea life. This river was possible due to the
          global sea level at the time, which was about 300 meters above today's
          levels. It might be good to add that this existed during the Late
          Cretaceous era, meaning it existed some 100 - 66 million years ago. I
          would like to make you aware of the fact that even when the sea levels
          were this high, Richat Dome would still be 500 km from the coastline.
          According to the data I've found, the coast has mostly stayed the same
          for millions of years. This area has never been close to any more
          extensive body of water during a time when humans existed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Corsetti is throwing numbers around trying to make his idea of a
          water-covered Sahara, combining land rise and sea levels with numbers
          that I have no idea where he got them from. Some areas indeed see an
          annual land rise; for example, Scandinavia, due to it having been
          pushed down by the giant glaciers, has seen a land rise. We know how
          large it has been historically and can use this data to calculate in
          software like ArcGIS, where the coastlines have been. Mainly since we
          find harbors and other things associated with the sea inland where it
          should not have been. But this process is not something we see in
          Africa since the giant glaciers did not push the continent down.
          Corsetti is making the same mistakes as Hancock; they looked at a
          graph and then tried to apply the data without completely
          comprehending it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="archaeology">Archaeology in the Richat Structure</h3>
        <p>
          Then we have the archaeological evidence, and there have been
          excavations, especially since there have been finds of Acheulean
          industries within the outer parts of the Richat dome. Acheulean is a
          type of hand axe technology that's maybe most associated with Homo
          Erectus but was used by Neanderthals too, but the technology
          disappeared around 130 000 years ago. Then there are finds of your
          typical Neolithic Saharan arrowheads and later iron spearheads in the
          area. Something we would expect from hunting and other
          activities.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I must admit that the archaeology in the area seems relatively sparse,
          but from the excavations and surveys, nothing indicates a city like
          Atlantis existed here. Just think about the artifacts that should
          still be here if Plato's description was accurate. In the account, he
          tells us that each ring had a thick wall coated in a metal layer, and
          each ring had a different metal. Just imagine how sturdy such a wall
          must have been. Then we have the buildings, the roads, the harbors,
          the metalwork, masonry, and all the other things we could find.
          Imagine how much food and waste a city like this would produce. I've
          excavated relatively small settlements, and even there, we find almost
          a literal ton of bones from animals, broken pottery, and other waste
          people leave behind. Nothing of this has been found in the Richat
          structure or its vicinity. Corsetti uses a bit of special pleading
          here, claiming that these things are not left due to Atlantis's
          destruction. But it's hard to believe that even a flash flood would
          not leave a foundation behind but spare Acheulean tool deposits and
          Neolithic arrowheads. Arrowheads that might have been contemporary
          with Atlantis itself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending quite some time investigating Atlantis and the Richat
          structure, I think there's not much left of Corsetti's evidence. When
          being looked at through a neutral lens, each claim was disproven. I
          believe this might be Jimmy's most prominent issue; he is not going
          out looking for the truth. He, just like Hancock and others, picks an
          idea and then starts to select data confirming their beliefs. Things
          that don't confirm their idea is set to the side and ignored, or even
          worse, altered. As I mentioned, Corsetti does bring up some of the
          things I've told you today, but often without context or has made
          significant changes to the facts. He even rewrites Plato's words so
          the story will fit his ideas. So I hope you, Jimmy, listen to or read
          this and rethink your approach. Or even better, you put out a
          correction. I'd be happy to help you with that and give any support I
          can.&nbsp;
