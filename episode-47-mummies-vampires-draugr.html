          Halloween is soon upon us. Therefore, we will venture into the world
          of mummies, vampires, Camazotz, and draugr from an archaeological
          perspective. So we will look at how mummies became a medicine in
          Europe, the Book of the Dead, and the afterlife of Ancient Egypt. Then
          we will talk about the bat creature Camazotz, usually depicted with a
          knife and a human head in his hand. Lastly, we will discuss the draugr
          from Viking mythology. Was the draugr a ghost, undead, or something
          else, and what did the Vikings do to protect themselves from these
          creatures?
        </p>
        <p>
          Are there any archeological records of these beings, and what can we
          say about them?
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 47, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. It is Halloween season, meaning it&rsquo;s time
          for a spooktacular. In honor of this, I&rsquo;ve watched episode 14
          from season 3, called &ldquo;Aliens and the Undead.&rdquo; So, in this
          episode, we will look closer at medical cannibalism, mummies, and the
          Book of the Dead. That&rsquo;s not all, but also vampires and if
          Camazotz and Draugr could be alien vampires. While dealing with what
          is often described as monsters in our popular culture, this episode
          will not be scary. I will, however, deal with the macabre, such as
          death, human sacrifice, and cannibalistic medicine. As usual, nothing
          is explicit or graphic, but I am giving you, my listener, a heads-up
          on this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There, you can also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if you want to learn how to support the show and the
          Archaeological Podcast Network, I will tell you more at the end of the
          episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2>Mummies</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start this spooktacular by talking about mummies. Something we
          all know well from our popular media and a topic that has fascinated
          people for centuries. Ideas and legends have been spread about mummies
          in Europe since at least the 11th century. In these earlier periods,
          the mummy was not seen as a person or an object but as medicine. By
          1500 CE, any pharmacy worth its salt would stock Mumia, a mixture made
          out of powdered mummies from Egypt to cure all sorts of
          ailments.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="cannibal">Medicinal cannibalism and spelling errors</h3>
        <p>
          This rather strange idea originates from an unfortunate translation
          issue. The word mummy originates not from Ancient Egypt but most
          likely from the Persian word mūm, meaning wax. You see, in some of the
          Persian hills, bitumen is seeping naturally out of the rocks. It is a
          highly viscous liquid that might be more familiar to you by its modern
          name, asphalt. So, it's a semi-solid petroleum substance that was used
          in some instances in medicine to cure broken limbs and other issues.
          It became known as an expensive but very effective cure for especially
          broken limbs and other illnesses. So, mūm was commonly known in the
          crescent area. However, Karl Dannenfeldt noted that there is a local
          name in some parts of Persia, mumiya. While the Arabic word for
          mummified body is mūmiyā, a physician in Bagdad called Rhazes referred
          to mumiya as medical bitumen around 900 CE. Mumiya, as medical
          bitumen, was shortly after picked up by another famous physician named
          Ibn Sina. From there, it spread and started to enter European
          writings, where the translation issues soon became apparent with our
          20/20 hindsight.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Latin writers such as Gerard of Cremona and Constantinius Africanus
          translated Mumia to refer to a substance originating from mummified
          bodies in Egypt. From there, the definition of mumiya was tied to
          mummified bodies. That they either contained the substance or were the
          origin of the substance. Like a game of telephone, the original
          meaning of black shiny asphalt from Persia became a mummified human.
          It did not help either that the early idea was that mummification was
          done with the help of asphalt.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the idea that consuming human remains could cure different
          conditions was not novel in Europe. Between 0 and about the 6th
          century, gladiator blood was used to cure epilepsy. Human fat was used
          in ointments and remedies around the 15th century. So, medical
          cannibalism was a rather accepted practice in Europe when mummy powder
          became a highly sought-after remedy.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But when did mummy become synonymous with a sort of monster? For that,
          we might have to thank Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and his novel Lot No.
          249. Authors had incorporated mummies and Egypt in their writing for
          some time. Jane C Loudon published 1827 the book "The Mummy!: Or a
          Tale of the Twenty-Second Century," in which a reanimated Cheops
          experience the 22nd century. Even Edgar Allan Poe wrote a mummy story,
          but it's maybe a bit more satirical than scary. Doyle was the first to
          portray mummies as monsters, something menacing and dangerous. Quite
          the contrast to his other novel, The Ring of Thoth, which could almost
          be described as a love story between an Egyptologist and a mummy. But
          there is also the hunt for the elixir of life, eternal science, and a
          romantic idea of ancient science.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why are we talking about mummies, other than it's time for
          spooktacular? For starters, putting things in context like this puts
          our ideas of mummies in perspective. Mummies are strange in a way
          since they are an odd mix of human remains and artifacts. I think it's
          good that we remind ourselves that these were humans with hopes and
          dreams and not just monsters. But also, Ancient Aliens have found a
          way to put a spin on the Egyptian burial costumes. Let us start with
          something that might surprise some: the Book of the Dead.
        </p>
        <h3 id="bookofthedead">Book of the Dead</h3>
        <p>
          "<em
            >To help Tutankhamun on his journey into the afterlife the walls and
            ceiling of his burial chamber were decorated with illustrations from
            the Egyptian's sacred Book of the Dead.</em
          >" - Narrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          So here is the thing: this is not something that only Ancient Alien
          writers get wrong but quite many of us. It's pretty understandable to
          think about the Book of the Dead as one complete story or narrative
          that is the same through time. It's more correct to view the Book of
          the Dead as a compilation of smaller pieces of text, many of which are
          called spells. These spells range from very long, such as Book of the
          Dead spell 17; these chapters are often shortened to DB, and I'll do
          the same. DB 17 is one of the spells found in most mortuary texts,
          identifying the deceased with the creator god Nun. Compare this to the
          relatively short chapter DB 6 found in most mortuary texts that bring
          your servant dolls, Ushabti, to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name itself is not even what the Egyptians called the texts. This
          is a later name originating from the German word totenbuch. This can
          mean a death register or a more scare-sounding book of the dead. The
          people in Egypt also referred to the documents found in tombs as kutub
          al-umwat. It's for sure that these terms came into use during the 19th
          century. The Egyptians called the texts Books of Going Forth by Day.
          These mortuary writings were supposed to help the deceased journey
          through the underworld and be reborn as an Akh, a glorified spirit.
          The going forth by day part refers to the Ba, one part of the human
          soul. If all the rites and spells were correctly done, you would have
          a fully functioning Ba that could move between our world and the next.
          That way, the Akh could gain rejuvenation and rebirth with the cosmos
          each day.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we speak about the Book of the Dead, a more fitting description
          of these spells might be mortuary texts. Because we have seen
          variations in these texts throughout the old, middle, and new
          kingdoms. I think you might be familiar with Pyramid texts and Coffin
          texts. As the name suggests, the pyramid texts are mortuary texts
          carved into a pyramid's walls. But if you go into the pyramid of Khufu
          at the Giza plateau, you will quickly realize that the walls are bare.
          That's because the practice was started later by the pharao Unas
          around 2375 BCE. Unas had about 283 spells, many of which were also
          found in the Pepe I and Merenre I pyramids. And how I learned that
          these texts were introduced to the commoners during the first
          intermediate period when society had collapsed, and people were
          plundering the tombs of the kings. They then saw that the kings had
          spells to make them immortal, so they copied them and democratized, so
          to say, the afterlife.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I must admit that I liked this story, and why not? It's an exciting
          story of how the lower classes gained access to an afterlife not meant
          for them. Since then, however, more research has been done, and it
          seems the coffin and pyramid texts are both built on an earlier
          tradition. In several Pyramid texts, we see that the spells are
          composed to someone who is not royalty or does not refer to the king
          as the beneficiary of the spell. In the mortuary temples, we see lists
          that contain the same items as the pyramid texts. These items are, in
          turn, depicted in private chapels as offerings to their deceased. In
          the tombs of officials, we also find in their biographies carved in
          the tomb references of them now being Akh, a holy spirit, a term used
          in the pyramid texts when proceeding to the next world. These texts
          were also thought to have been written originally by Toth, the god of
          writing from whom magic and science came.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spells were also an integral part of Egyptian society and religion.
          The sun god Ra, as an example, owned his continued trip with the sun
          disk to Toth. The horrible monster Aapep lay in wait each morning,
          ready to attack where the sunrise started. The gods could not kill
          this dreadful beast, but Toth created a spell that would make the
          creature's limbs lame.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Writing things down in Ancient Egypt also ensured that the rites and
          spells would be performed for eternity. So, if the priests were no
          longer there to utter the spells and perform the rituals, the spells
          were thought to be completed anyway. Offerings would be presented, and
          the Akh could rejuvenate each day even if no one was there to give it
          offerings. It was a failsafe, so to speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coffin texts started to become a thing around the 11th dynasty and
          used some of the Pyramid texts as a foundation. But the spells would
          vary depending on time, place, and how much room there was in the
          coffin. It's important to note that no standardized version of these
          mortuary texts existed until around 600 BCE. But the practice evolved,
          and the spells were written on the linen wrapped around the mummy to
          get more room. Later, they would start to use papyrus, which most of
          us refer to when speaking about the Book of the Dead. So, while they
          didn't say something incorrect here, I felt we could benefit from
          learning more about the Book of the Dead. This is only a scratch on
          the surface, and in the show notes, you will find more resources if
          you would like to learn more about the topic. But let's continue to
          see if we can find the connection between Egypt, mummies, and aliens.

        <h3 id="elongatedskulls">Elongated skulls in Ancient Egypt?</h3>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Archaeologists have found that in Egypt, like Tutankhamun or his
            sister, who's this statue here, Meritaten, had these strange
            elongated heads. You have to wonder, were they trying to imitate
            extraterrestrials who looked like this, or perhaps they, in fact,
            were extraterrestrials, and this is how they naturally looked.</em
          >" - David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I want to make something clear here: Ancient Egypt did not
          practice Artificial Cranial Deformation. While there are instances of
          the practice, the oldest confirmed find of ACD in Egypt is around 600
          BCE. Tutankhamun died around 1323 BCE. Research has been done on what
          is believed to be the Akenathens cranium and King Tut; no one has so
          far gone and claimed that they show signs of Artificial Cranial
          Deformation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have discussed the problematic history of the Cephalic index in the
          past, but if we want to discuss long and short heads, it has its uses.
          So, Tutankhamun has a cephalic index of 83.9. With this number, he
          barely qualifies for the brachycephalic group; the most common cutoff
          value for men is 83.1. Brachycephalic skulls are short and broad; in
          the animal kingdom, a pug would be the most extreme example of this
          shape. So whenever you think about Tutankhamun, you can associate him
          with a pug.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In a study from 2010 called "Ancestry and Pathology in King
          Tutankhamun's Family," the authors used molecular genetics and Ancient
          DNA to see if any conditions could cause elongated skulls. Some
          medical conditions are associated with elongated skulls. While it
          would not be artificial deformation, we might be able to see some
          genetics that could indicate that it was the case. However, when
          studied, the authors noted no signs of "gynecomastia,
          craniosynostoses, Antley-Bixler syndrome or deficiency in cytochrome
          P450 oxidoreductase, Marfan syndrome, or related disorders."
        </p>
        <p>
          The study did not focus only on Tutankhamun but his whole known family
          that we have found so far. The cephalic index and genetics were the
          same for the entire family; the depictions of the family with longer
          heads seem to have been an artistic choice. It's still a relatively
          open question as to why they did it; the head was not associated with
          intelligence per se. The Egyptians believed you thought with your
          heart. It's a pretty logical idea when you think about it since the
          heart reacts to things by pumping slower or faster. The most likely
          answer to why Akhenaten chose to be depicted as he and his family was
          where to separate them from the rest of society. He wanted them to
          stand out since they were living representations of a god, Aten. In
          places where we see ACD, it's not as much that the society wants one
          or two to stick out, but the act is done as a form of ethnic unity and
          comradery.
        </p>
        <p>But where did this idea originate from?</p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >I'm suggesting that mummification is based on our ancestors who
            watched extraterrestrials getting ready for a flight through deep
            space. One possibility is to be frozen or to be put into animated
            sleep, where you're inside this quote end quote 'sarcophagus', this
            coffin. And so our ancestors might have watched is type of
            preparation, and then they misunderstood this for the gods dying.
            And so our ancestors mummified themselves in order to be ready for
            the return of the gods with the hopes that the gods would reanimate
            them from the dead in the future.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          This is a fantastic story, right? It's the most creative idea that an
          Ancient Alien proponent has developed so far. It's a fun sci-fi spin,
          but as usual, things start to fall apart when we compare this to the
          reality of what the Ancient Egyptians believed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="afterlife">Afterlife in Ancient Egypt</h3>
        <p>
          So, let's deal a little with the Egyptian afterlife. This topic is a
          bit more complex than our Western idea of the afterlife, especially if
          you are a part of the Christian, Muslim, or even Jewish faith. While
          Christians have the idea of being judged in the afterlife just as the
          Ancient Egyptians, it's only the judgment part that is similar. Just
          the trip to the point where your life would be judged was a hassle.
          That's why you needed those Book of the Deads and coffin texts. You
          needed to know all the secret handshakes and have some protection with
          you. Also, your chances might be limited if your family didn't add the
          proper rituals. If they did not include DB 23, for example, the
          ceremony to open your mouth, you could have trouble with some of the
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>"My mouth is given to me,</p>
        <p>My mouth is opened by Ptah,</p>
        <p>With that chisel of metal</p>
        <p>With which he opened the mouth of the gods.</p>
        <p>I am Sekhmet-Wadjet who dwells in the west of heaven,</p>
        <p>I am Sahyt among the souls of On."</p>
        <p>
          Because when you had passed through all the gates, made the proper
          handshakes, answered the riddles, and bested the beasts, the person
          could enter the Hall of Two Truths. There, they were supposed to
          recite the negative confessions, handily listed in DB 125, and contain
          things like.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I gave bread to the hungry, beer to the thirsty, clothes to the
          naked. /.../ I have not deprived a orphan of his property."
        </p>
        <p>
          After this, the famous ritual of weighing the heart against the
          feather, a representation of Maat, the good of truth, if the heart was
          lighter than a feather, the person could become part of Osiris. When
          that happened, you became a transformed Akh and had a pleasant
          afterlife in the Duat. If you failed this trial, then you were no
          more. The Ancient Egyptians did not have a concept of hell. You either
          went to the next world, or you ceased to exist. A fate that was an
          utterly terrifying thought to the Egyptians.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've brought up two concepts earlier, Akh and Ba. Akh, as you notice,
          is the person's spirit after death and the representation of the
          individual. Then we have the Ba, one part of your soul. In Egyptian
          art, it is represented by a bird with a human face. This part of the
          soul stayed with the body in the dark tomb during the night and,
          during the day, went out in the sunshine. As you remember, this is the
          origin of the Egyptian name for the Book of the Dead.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have the Ka, the life energy, and a body double, more or less.
          It's represented by two arms stretched up. I might make an American or
          two happy now, like the referee in your American football during a
          field goal. A common euphemism for "to die" was to say "to go to one's
          Ka." While this part of your soul existed at birth, the Ka was most
          associated with death. It was also the part of the soul that needed
          material sustenance. So, the grave good was given to ensure that the
          Ka would not starve, and in a pinch, writing or depicting rituals of
          providing food and beer could suffice.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But to live again, the body needed to be intact; without it, the Ka
          and the Ba had no anchor, and the Akh would cease to exist. That's why
          they mummified the bodies and even created backup devices like Ka and
          Ba statues. Even the coffins were turned into a sort of failsafe
          device. During the Old Kingdom box coffins were mainly used. But this
          would change, and anthropoid coffins had replaced the box version by
          the time of the Middle Kingdom. So everything was designed to ensure
          you would have an afterlife because if your body was destroyed or your
          Ba could not recognize it, you were gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea that the Ancient Egyptians tried to imitate alien cryostasis
          does not make sense. However, it is interesting that you could be
          thrown out even if you enter the Duat or their idea of heaven. During
          this time, the Akh, Ka, and Ba existed alongside each other. As you
          notice, the Egyptian afterlife is far more complex than the Ancient
          Alien theorists give them credit for.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we could spend much more time on Mummies and the afterlife, we
          will leave the topic here for now. The show did not go into
          mummification here, and I think that topic deserves a lot of attention
          and most likely its own segment. So keep an eye out for that. Let's
          have a break here, but when we return, we will deal with the famous
          vampire.
        </p>
        <h2 id="vampires">Vampires</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome back! Let's continue this travel into the night's horrors by
          examining the vampire! A creature that has captivated our imagination
          for centuries. Like the Egyptian mummy, the vampire has been a staple
          of popular media, such as poems and books, since the mid-1700s. And
          it's somewhere there the idea of the sophisticated vampire villain
          would start to take shape. While we often associate vampire lore with
          the Slavic regions and Romania, these creatures can be found in many
          other locations. However, they drastically differ from each other, and
          the only similarity is often limited to being undead and consuming a
          living person's life force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even a simple thing like where a vampire would bite you differs across
          Europe. Today, the vampire is associated chiefly with drinking blood
          from the neck, but not all vampires drink blood. If they would bite
          you, the location would differ; among the Kashuban population in
          modern Poland, the vampire would bite the left breast. In Russia, they
          make a hole in your chest above the heart; in Gdansk, they would
          nibble your nipple. Some will drink blood, some will eat flesh, and
          some will just consume your life force. (shadows quote)
        </p>
        <p>
          How to create a vampire differs to the extreme. In Greece, you could
          become a vampire simply by an animal jumping over your corpse. In
          Russia, suicide and drowning victims were known to come back as
          vampires.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But why are we talking about vampires other than the spooktacular?
          I'll let the narrator take us there.
        </p>
        <h3 id="camazotz">Camazotz</h3>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Oaxaca, Mexico. Situated on a low mountain range rising above the
            central plain, lie the ancient ruins of Monte Alb&aacute;n. Here,
            around 100 BC, researchers believe the Zapotec Indians worshipped a
            bloodthirsty Mayan god with the body of a man and the head of a bat.
            They called him Camazotz.</em
          >" - Narrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Camazotz is a creature that seems to have created some confusion
          online and within the alien community. If you google Camazotz, one of
          the first images you will see is a Batman mask that looks to have been
          created by the Mayans. It was not. It was created by the Mexican
          designer Anlita Kimbal in 2014 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of
          DC's Batman comic. It was part of an exhibition where several other
          artists released their version of Batman.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that out of the way, we can focus on if there was a god called
          Camazotz. The name means, in the Kʼicheʼ language, death bat. It is an
          appropriate name since the bats were symbols of rot, destruction, and
          death in Mesoamerica. In some stories, the bats are associated with
          blood sacrifice, and it seems as if the people knew that the bats
          drank blood not by biting but by slicing a small wound and then
          lapping the blood. However, only two out of the 120 species living in
          Mesoamerica drink blood. Most of the others eat fruits, nectar, and
          insects. That some bats snatch fruits out of the trees might be why
          the bats are associated with decapitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the classic Maya society, bats are usually rendered with eyes
          almost popping out of their sockets and symbols of death like bones
          and skulls around them. In the postclassic Maya society, we start to
          see them more associated with sacrifice, and they are depicted with
          flint knives and severed heads. The classic Zapotec mostly finds bats
          painted on the funerary urns. But we also have other depictions of the
          bat holding a chipped knife, as in the postclassic period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most known story featuring Camazotz might be the Kʼicheʼ Popul
          Vuh. This a story we discuss in more detail in episode 28. Popul Vuh
          is a story that, in part, follows the hero twins, and they are about
          to play a match against the lords of the underworld. These lords are
          not keen on the idea of a potential loss, so they try to cheat.
          Letting the hero twins sleep in the House of Bats, why is it named
          like that? Well, because it's filled with bats, who are, of course,
          trying to kill the hero twins. The twins manage to seek shelter inside
          their blow-guns. But Hannahpu started to wonder if the sun would rise
          and peaked up, and immediately, one bat swooped down and took his head
          off. The head was given to the Lords of the Underworld to use as a
          ball in their next game. The other brother, Xbalanque, got help from
          an opossum and other animals to replace the head with a pumpkin.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the bats clearly had their place within the mythology of
          Mesoamerica. But as far I can tell, Camazotz had no temples or cults.
          While having a vital position within the religion, they were not a god
          in their own right. And as far we can tell, the chief patron deity of
          Monte Alban was the rain god Cocijo. This god is often portrayed with
          a hooked nose and the tongue of the serpent. The second popular diety
          is Xipe Totec, and this fellow is not the god for those faint of
          heart. The name translates to the flayed one. This god is often
          depicted dressed in human skin, wearing a headdress, and holding a
          bloody knife. Xipe Totec was predominantly a god of agriculture. It
          was believed that he sacrificed himself by flaying his own skin off to
          give nurture to the fields. During his festivals, a slave often had to
          stand in as a representative of the god. Sacrifices were caught during
          wars they engaged in. But with the skin and blood, the ground would
          bear plenty of food.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd say that focusing on Xipe Totec might have been a better choice,
          to be honest. But I assume they wanted a bat since that is more
          Western-centric. Speaking of Westernism, we will now move up to my
          neck of the woods and the cold, dark north.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="draugr">Draugr</h3>
        <p>
          "<em
            >In Norse mythology, a draugr was a person who lived a sinful life.
            After dying, they would come back from the dead and haunt the
            living</em
          >." - Narrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of you who listen might be most familiar with the draugr from the
          game Skyrim, in which they are animated corpses defending their tombs.
          But Draugr does not have a good counterpart within the other cultures.
          Sure, as skeptics, we can here argue that it does not matter since no
          ghosts, vampires, or other spirits are real. But when we want to track
          an idea or folklore from an anthropological perspective, it does help
          if we can categorize it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially in Iceland, the medieval ghost differed from the continent.
          In contrast to the well-known see-through specter,&nbsp; the Icelandic
          spirit came with a body. So here, already, they are more similar to
          the idea of a vampire. But the idea of the draugr is far more
          complicated than this. You see, in all those stories that are usually
          referred to as examples of draugr, the word is never used. In the
          Grettirs saga, it's often said that the character Glam is a draugr,
          but the word is never used. Instead, we see <em>aptrogongur </em>or
          <em>reimleikar </em>being used in the stories. The same in other
          examples like Laxd&aelig;la or Eyrbyggja saga, we don't see the term
          in reference to the ghosts at Fr&oacute;&eth;&aacute; nor about
          &THORN;&oacute;r&oacute;lf Lame-Foot.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While the term draugr was used during the Viking and medieval eras, we
          don't see it associated with any of the most famous examples. Often,
          we rather see it being used to describe an enemy. But it is suggested
          that the term draugr is connected to the poetic metaphor of describing
          the dead as wood. A poetic description we have preserved in
          Solarljo&eth; goes as follows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tunga min / vas til tres metin / ok kolnat at fyr utan" "My tounge /
          was like wood / and it was cold outside." Another poetic description
          is "a wooden log you where (a reference to the creation of human
          story), a wooden log (draugr) you will become."&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What might be the real connection between draugr and the undead in the
          stories is that they are referred to as troll or troll-like. With
          troll, I don&rsquo;t mean the creatures that turn into stone in
          sunlight or fight the fellowship of the ring in Moria. No, in the
          Scandinavian languages, <em>troll </em>can also be translated to magic
          or witchcraft. And it can be applied to witches, ghosts, demons, or
          even the giant creatures that one might find in Moria. Basically, any
          outcast with magical properties would be affected by troll or use
          magical powers in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why is Glam associated with being a draugr while the word is never
          used? Well, it stems from how he became a draugr and what happened
          after. Glam did not start out as an undead creature of the night; he
          was a great fighter and monster hunter from Sweden. Within the
          Grettirs saga is a farmer named &THORN;&oacute;rhallur/Thorhall, and
          he has issues with evil spirits that drain the life force of his
          sheep. Thorhall got the recommendation to hire Glam to solve his
          issues. I like that in the story when Thorhall points out to Glam that
          the place has evil spirits, Glam retorts, "Ekki hr&aelig;&eth;ist eg
          flykur &thorn;&aelig;r," sag&eth;i Gl&aacute;mur, "og &thorn;ykir
          m&eacute;r a&eth; &oacute;dauflega." "Such bugs will not scare me,"
          quoth Glam; "life seems to me less irksome thereby."
        </p>

          But Glam should have been scared; he did not survive the encounter
          with the meinv&aelig;ttr (evil spirit). But here is why draugr is more
          vampire than a ghost. If killed by this creature, you yourself will
          become one. Another little factoid here is that we have some potential
          werewolf crossover because Glam is described after his death as having
          &ldquo;<em>&uacute;lfgr&aacute;r &aacute; h&aacute;rslit</em>&rdquo;
          or, in English, &ldquo;with wolf grey hair.&rdquo; But as things turn
          out, Grettir is then called upon to solve this new creature that
          haunts the valley. Glam killed the first one but took his place. There
          seems to be some sort of connection between these two monster hunters,
          almost like the Winchester brothers in Supernatural. The two seem to
          have some sort of understanding between each other and in the end,
          Glam is bested. But Grettir is hit by Glam's evil eye and turns into a
          cruel being and an outcast. In the end, even Grettir is being referred
          to as troll by a society that shun him. It was almost as if the draugr
          took parts of his life force.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we learn here that, in a sense, the draugr or this type of undead
          is contagious. So it seems to get nourishment from the living, not
          their blood but their life force. And getting bitten or in contact
          with the draugr will make you one in the end. Another interesting
          aspect is as the show actually points out, this curse seems to develop
          initially in selfish, greedy, and evil people. Glam was not a good
          person. Therefore, he is more susceptible to the curse compared to
          Grettir. But the curse can take hold of a corpse if the person was
          evil in their life too. Something that becomes clear when reading the
          Laxd&aelig;la saga or Eyrbyggja saga.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Laxd&aelig;la, V&iacute;ga-Hrappr is described as being unfair and
          next to paranoid in protecting his land from his neighbors. As his
          death draws near, V&iacute;ga becomes more aggressive, and upon his
          death, he is described as being &ldquo;bad as he was in life, the
          worse he got in death.&rdquo; While dead, he is the same person, just
          much worse. The story kind of repeats itself with
          &THORN;&oacute;r&oacute;lf Lame-Foot, except that
          &THORN;&oacute;r&oacute;lf hates anyone younger than him. Even his son
          gets a taste of that hatred. In that story, the draugr of
          &THORN;&oacute;r&oacute;lf is the same person, except his hatred
          increased in death. What connects these stories is that both these men
          don&rsquo;t want to give up power and let the younger step forward.
          But none of the men seem to be suffering in their fate, but their
          surroundings do. These spirits killed their old servants, family, and
          neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another interesting thing that Sayer points out in the essay
          &ldquo;Alien and the Alienated&rdquo; is that ghosts are associated
          with evil or marginalized people in medieval Icelandic texts. If you
          were in the outskirts of society, you were more likely to be
          associated with troll and the undead than those who participated with
          the norm.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But can we see that the Scandinavians during the Viking age worry or
          take any precautions to avoid people returning as undead? Kind of. We
          have at least two runestones in Denmark. One is found at N&oslash;rre
          N&aelig;r&aring; with signum DR 211; on it, we can read &ldquo;<em
            >&THORN;ōrmundR. Niūt kumbls</em
          >.&rdquo; or in English, &ldquo;Thormund, enjoy the burial
          mound.&rdquo; On DR 239, located in G&oslash;rlevs perish, we have a
          spell written on the stone. On it we can read:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;&THORN;iu&thorn;wi res&thorn;i sten &thorn;&aelig;nsi &aelig;ft
          O&thorn;inkor fu&thorn;orkhniastbmlʀ niut w&aelig;l kumbls!
          &thorn;istill/mistill/kistill, iak satta ru[na]ʀ ret&ldquo; -
          G&oslash;rlev 1.
        </p>
        <p>Translated to English, we learn the following:</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Tjodvi erected this stone after Odinkar. Enjoy the mound well.
            Thistle, mistle, whistle, I wrote the runes well.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The word-for-word translation here would be &ldquo;thistle, mistle,
          small chest,&rdquo; but I decided to be a bit more artistic and keep
          the rhyme. This spell is also found on a Swedish stone, &Ouml;G 181,
          and in Borgund stave church in Norway. But these two carvings seem to
          be aimed to keep the dead happy in the ground. There is also a find in
          Sweden of a small bronze plate with a spell on it that seems to be
          aimed at keeping the dead down. The plate called the H&ouml;gstena
          plate (Vg 216) was found in 1920 when workers at a cemetery were doing
          some work in the ground. On it, we can read over the rather poorly
          written runes:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Gal anda vi&eth;r, gangla vi&eth;r, ri&eth;anda vi&eth;(r),
            vi&eth;r rinnanda, vi&eth;r s[it]ianda, vi&eth;r sign[and]a,
            vi&eth;r f[a]randa, vi&eth;r fliughanda. S[kal] alt fy[r]na ok um
            d&oslash;[i]a.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >I Galdr toward the spirits. Toward those prone to walk, towards the
            rider, the runner, the sitting. Towards the hardened, the traveler,
            and the flying one. The evil one will leave and die.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have here some examples where it seems as if the people during
          the Viking age tried to some degree to stop the dead from rising
          again. From these small samples, it&rsquo;s hard to say this was a
          widespread practice. What we can say is that to some, this was a
          concern they had. But not everyone would have the means of carving
          these spells in stone or bronze, it could be argued that wood would
          have been used more commonly. Unfortunately, these have not been
          preserved to our age, and this is speculation from my end here. While
          these are just stories, they still give us an insight into the world
          of medieval Scandinavians. The warnings and lessons they tried to
          share through the stories.&nbsp;

          On that note, I will close out the episode. We did not find those
          elusive aliens this time either, but maybe we have better luck next
          time.
