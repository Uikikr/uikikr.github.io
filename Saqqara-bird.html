          1899, somewhere in the Memphis Necropolis close to Saqqara,
          Egypt,&nbsp; a few workmen were digging. They were excavating a
          Mastaba, covered by the desert sand. After a while one of the workmen
          noticed something, a sealed entrance to the tomb. It seems to still be
          sealed. They shout to gain the attention from Mr Loret, the leader of
          the excavation. Together they broke the seal and opened the tomb.
          Inside were wonderous things but one little wooden bird was put to the
          side and nearly forgotten. It wasn&rsquo;t until Khalil Messiha saw
          the item at the Egyptian Museum it would start to take off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hi I&rsquo;m Fredrik and I&rsquo;m the host of archeologists and UFOs.
          What you just heard is my artistic rendering on how today's item was
          found. This is the podcast where we cover artifacts and ideas from
          ancient aliens and see if they are true or not. Today we will talk
          about the Saqqara bird, a little wooden statue where little research
          has been done but many claims have been made about it. Some believe
          that this is evidence that the ancient Egyptians did know how to
          fly.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What we do know is that the bird is made out of wood and is 18 cm
          long. It has inventarie numbers JE 33109, SR 4/ 6347. It was excavated
          by Victor Loret during 1899 but unfortunately we don&rsquo;t have a
          more exact date on when it was found. The item was discovered in the
          Memphis Necropolis close to Saqqara, the location is unfortunately not
          noted in The Registration Collection Management and Documentation
          Department at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It&rsquo;s not mentioned
          in Lorets own notes for 1899 either. Leaving us to wonder exactly
          where Loret found it. But today you would be able to find it in room
          22 at the Egyptian museum in Cairo.

        <p>
          I have seen references to a Pad-di-imen or amun but it is based on an
          article in Egypt Travel Magazine number 153 from 1973. Except that
          number 153 was published in 1969 and that the magazine does not seem
          to have been published in the 70's. So my suspicion is that this
          article does not exist, but if you dear listeners happen to have it,
          feel free to send it to me. Prove me wrong on this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          But from the style and context we&rsquo;re quite sure it&rsquo;s from
          the Ptolemaic period in Egypt. So it&rsquo;s from somewhere between
          305 BCE and 30 CE with the death of Cleopetra the seventh. The
          ptolemaic period is the last dynasty of what we might call the
          classical Egypt. The Ptolemaic dynasty started after the death of
          Alexander the Great and one of his generals, Ptolemy I Soter, seized
          power in Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we know very little but where do all of these claims come from? It
          started with Khalil Messiha, he was a physician and a dowser. Apart
          from his interest in new age methods of finding things he was a flight
          enthusiast. One day at the Egyptian Museum he spotted this little
          wooden bird and thought &ldquo;hey, that looks quite
          aerodynamic&rdquo;. Exactly when this happened is as with a lot in
          this story unclear. But he did go on to publish an article in 1991
          called&nbsp; "Aeronautics: African Experimental Aeronautics: A
          2000-Year Old Model Glider". Messiha does say that this wooden bird is
          a model of a glider.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at it, sure it looks somewhat aerodynamic, but at the same
          point so do statues in general of birds. But people who believe that
          this would represent a glider point towards the horizontal tail. Birds
          usually don&rsquo;t have a horizontal tail, they have a vertical tail.
          Why you might ask? It&rsquo;s so a horizontal stabilizer with flaps
          can go there. According to the proponents it&rsquo;s broken off. But
          if you were to look closely you would notice that it does have a small
          dent. But on top of the tail, if you look closely, is a smooth
          surface. So the stabilizer was not carved out on the top. The Egyptian
          woodwork would have used plugs as for the wings so I don&rsquo;t think
          anything went on to the tail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s humor the sailplane theory. How would it be launched?
          Today the most common way to launch a sailplane today is with another
          airplane. But the proponents at least don&rsquo;t think they had
          engines back then, so how? Well, the main idea seems to be that they
          used a catapult. But then we have another issue, from what I find it
          seems as if they mean a trebuchet. Sure, there was a trebuchet-like
          catapult in china from the 4th century BCE. But they seem to not have
          been popular in the mediterranean until the Byzantine empire.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s assume then they would use a greek catapult for this,
          it would be fitting for the ptolemaic dating of the bird. These
          catapults were not that big but some sources say that they could throw
          projectiles up toward 250 kg. So could it hearl an early glider plane?
          Depending on material, maybe? But I don&rsquo;t believe it would have
          been pleasant or efficient. It would probably just have been a tug on
          the rope and the plane moved a few meters. That might be a reason why
          you can&rsquo;t find examples of gliders launched with this method.
          Some proponents bring up the winch launch method and bungee cord
          method.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for the vinch method it&rsquo;s usually left out that it needs an
          engine that&rsquo;s quite powerful. So what they then do is to add a
          rope to the vinch and the plane and then quickly pull it preferably
          against the wind to get a higher launch. The bungee method then?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was somewhat used in the early days and some still use it today
          even if it&rsquo;s rare. For it to work you stand on the top of a
          large hill, you fasten an elastic bungee cord to a hook on the plane.
          Then you lock the wheels of the glider and then four people pull the
          cord back. On a signal the wheels are freed and the plane shouts out
          like an arrow. This should also be made with a strong headwind to get
          some extra lift. The downside is that with the bungy method you
          don&rsquo;t fly weary far. We also don&rsquo;t have any evidence that
          the ancient Egyptians made or had knowledge about rubber or access to
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s good to know that the prevailing wind pattern in Egypt is
          north to south. This is maybe most visible in depictions of boats on
          the Nile. If you look at a drawing you can see if the boat is
          traveling south or north by the presence of sails. No sail but ours
          means the boat is going north, sails and no oars means it&rsquo;s
          heading south.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we get to maybe the most important part. Is it really
          aerodynamically shaped? Well again, if you create a bird it will to
          some extent by default be aerodynamic. Just as a paper plane will
          somewhat fly.

          But all the different &ldquo;studies&rdquo; on how aerodynamic the
          bird really is usually have to admit that they have changed a few
          things on the bird.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the same when you can see it in
          different documentaries where they put it in wind tunnels. Usually the
          wings are shaped more as modern plane wings and it&rsquo;s a bit more
          streamlined. So this part doesn't really hold up either.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proponents haven&rsquo;t really shown how this little 18 cm statue
          would really be a scale model of a plane. Or what they would have used
          these for? It would have had a really limited range and uses. It could
          have been used as part of a religious ritual but then I think we would
          have seen more documentation of it from the ancient egyptians.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what was the bird made for then? To be honest we don&rsquo;t know,
          a local variation of Horus is one theory. Maybe it was a toy that was
          dear to the owner of the tomb? We do know that they tended to put in
          things that the deceased would have used for in the afterlife. Maybe
          it was an avid falconeer? To be honest, we don&rsquo;t know and maybe
          we'll never know for sure. But if it&rsquo;s something we can be sure
          of is that this is not evidence for gliders in ancient egypt.&nbsp;
