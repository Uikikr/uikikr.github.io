        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine alternative history and ancient alien narratives in popular
          media. Do these ideas hold water to an archeologist, or are there
          better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 70, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we will look at the infamous
          Kensington Runestone found in the USA and the claims made by Scott
          Wolter from America Unearthed. Is the stone evidence of templars and
          Scandinavians in the US? Or is it a creation in modern times?
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website,
          <a href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com"
            >diggingupancientaliens.com</a
          >. There you also find contact info if you notice any mistakes or have
          any suggestions. And if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if
          you left one of those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, letâ€™s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>

        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
        <p>
          Much like an irritating rash, the Kensington Runestone keeps returning
          when you think it's finally gone. It again popped up due to Scott
          Wolter's talk during the Cosmic Summit 2024 and TikToked about by
          Jahannah James&mdash;another promoter of pseudo-archaeological claims
          and lost civilizations. If you are not familiar with Scott Wolter, he
          is a geologist, but today, he may be more known as a TV host for the
          show America Unearthed. One of the entertainment shows promoting
          pseudohistorical claims put out by the History Channel. There are
          conspiracies, templars, the Ark of the Covenant in the US, and
          aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Scott Wolter has also long been a starch advocate for the authenticity
          of Kensington Runestone (KRS). Meaning the stone was created by
          American Vikings or at least Scandinavians hundreds of years before
          Columbus arrived in the Americas. So, let's once and for all put this
          matter to rest because the case has been closed for quite some time.
          But before we get into the nitty gritty about the Kensington
          runestone, we should maybe talk about what it is, where it was found,
          and when, and whether it's an important discovery in the first place.

        <p>
          Let me then take you back in time to the year 1898. A man named Olof
          &Ouml;hman, a Swedish immigrant, is working hard to clear Internal
          Improvement Land he recently took over in rural
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solem_Township,_Douglas_County,_Minnesota"
            >Solem in Minnesota</a
          >. Under a treestump, he is supposed to find a stone that he first
          claims might be an "Indian Calendar," his words, not mine. But the
          stone was later identified as being written with a runic script. I'll
          first give you the original language and then the English translation.

        <p>
          A theatrical yet short story. There's exploration, there's death and
          Christianity. Elements that might help us figure out why the stone was
          made later. I won't be coy about this; the stone is a hoax. I'll prove
          this from several angles, and all roads lead to a modern
          creation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We should touch on a couple of things before proceeding with
          &Ouml;hmans runestone. It's established that the Vikings were in the
          Americas before other Europeans. The discovery of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Anse_aux_Meadows"
            >L'Anse aux Meadows</a
          >
          in the 1970s was a huge deal and did show that the Norse sagas were
          correct about Vinland. However, this settlement was short-lived, and
          if you want to hear more about it, I'll have a tour of the site in the
          app Histourian soon. There's also a study from 2023 by L&iacute;sabet
          Gu&eth;mundsd&oacute;ttir showing that elite families in Greenland
          imported lumber from America. So, today's discussion isn't about
          whether the Vikings visited North America because we know that they
          did. So even if the runestone would be authentic, it would, as
          Professor
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl68fplNJM8BsG6uJLeHUfMYtNHeza5l_"
            >Kenneth Feder</a
          >
          puts it, "No clich&eacute;d rewriting of textbooks would be called
          for, maybe just a footnote." As we will see, however, the importance
          of the stone is more prominent as a reflection of modern history.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to point out that many authors make the mistake of
          connecting this stone with Vikings. By 1362, the Viking age was long
          gone. Sweden and Norway were well into the Middle Ages regarding art
          and culture. Iceland and Greenland had also followed these new
          influences at this point. So we should stop trying to connect the
          stone with Vikings; if it was real, early Nordic medieval would be a
          better term for the stone&mdash;not Norse or Viking.
        </p>

        <h2 id="the-runes">Let the Runes Speak</h2>
        <p>
          The most significant contributor to the confusion regarding Vikings in
          Minnesota might be that the message is written in runes. I don't think
          it's weird that people make this association. Still, the issue is that
          the runic script is not isolated to the Viking age. In Sweden, runes
          were used for everyday writing up until the 20th century. People were
          still using runes when the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was founded,
          and the Manhattan Bridge was open for traffic.
        </p>
        <p>
          But runes are not some monolithic writing system that's remained
          unchanged. No, we have several versions, which can be traced back to
          different periods. The oldest version of the runes dates back to
          around 100 CE. The system that developed is known as the Old
          Fu&thorn;ark. You might wonder what fu&thorn;ark means, and it's
          basically the ABC of the old Germanic writing system. We have found
          several stones where all the runes in the old Germanic alphabet are
          written out, and the first six signs are F, U, &thorn;, A, R, and K.
          The
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylver_Stone">Kylver stone</a>
          on Gotland in Sweden is the oldest example of a complete alphabet and
          dates back to around 400 CE. Other examples where we find a complete
          old futhark on the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadstena_bracteate"
            >Vadstena bracteate</a
          >
          and the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumpan_bracteate"
            >Grumpan bracteate</a
          >. These are medallions meant to be carried around the neck, a fairly
          common trinket found during this period in Swedish history.

          As I mentioned, this writing system evolved, and during 800 CE, the
          old Fu&thorn;ark was replaced by the new Fu&thorn;ark. The critical
          difference between these systems is that the old version contains 24
          runes while the younger contains 16. This is a bit of a paradox since
          we see new types of sounds in the language, meaning more runes would
          have been better than fewer. During the 9th century, we see, as
          expected, a period where runcarvers seemed to be able to handle both
          the new and old Fu&thorn;ark. The world's

          is found in R&ouml;k here in Sweden and is an example where the carver
          understood both writing systems.&nbsp;

          Almost all rune stones are written in the younger Fu&thorn;ark. Worth
          remembering, though, is that the runestones were carved mainly during
          the 11th century and that nearly a quarter of all known carvings in
          the world are from Uppland in Sweden. During what we would classify as
          the Viking Age, the young Fu&thorn;ark was the primary writing
          system.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But it would not last; we see yet another change as Sweden, Norway,
          and Denmark enter the early medieval age. The Latin alphabet became
          the primary writing system during this time, but the runes are still
          sticking around. Again, they change, and the runic fu&thorn;ark is
          replaced by the runic alphabet. The runes go from 16 back to 24 so
          they can fill out the complete alphabet that was being introduced.
          While most literate people in Sweden would prefer using the Latin
          alphabet, there were locations in Sweden such as Gotland, Dalarna, and
          J&auml;mtland where runes would stick around for much longer. This
          runic alphabet was used to write both Latin and Swedish. On a spindle
          whole found in J&auml;mtland, we can read "pax poranti, salus
          habenti," which translates to "Pace to the bearer, well-being to the
          possessor." There's also a shaving kit box with runic inscriptions
          from 1610 but written in Swedish from the era.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With this short crash course in Swedish runes, it becomes clear that
          different periods and regions have their own set of runes. So, where
          do the runes on the Kensington stone fit in? You might not be
          surprised that the runes used are neither the old nor young
          Fu&thorn;ark. I hate to bring bad news, but this completely rules out
          any Viking involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the Fu&thorn;ark ruled out, we're left with a runic alphabet.
          This gives us a window of 700 years, but of course, we can narrow this
          gap down to a smaller size. The Kensington runes were, for a long
          time, a bit of a mystery because no known alphabet we knew about did
          fit with what we see on the stone. Due to this, this type of runes has
          been known as Kensington runes. The first real breakthrough to finding
          where and when the runes were made came when the KRS was on loan and
          exhibition in Sweden in 2003. For the first time, experts in both
          Swedish and runes could effortlessly examine the inscription. Quite
          quickly, they realized that these runes looked like those found on a
          <a
            href="https://www.christerhamp.se/runor/gamla/d/dskansvakten1977.html"
            >yoke found in M&aring;ndalen</a
          >. The runes carved into the yoke said, "detta b&auml;rtr&auml; gorde
          jag den 10 September 1907 oos" and translated to English, saying, "I
          made this yoke on September 10 1907." It was made by a man called
          Perlas Olof Olsson and is the first connection between Sweden and the
          Kensington Runes. They could also quite early connect it to writings
          by a woman called
          <a
            href="https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/dalarna/blev-slagen-i-skolan-nar-hon-pratade-alvdalska-gerda-91-med-nar-viktig-skylt-invigdes"
            >Gerda Werf</a
          >
          from &Auml;lvdalen in the region of Dalarna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to the yoke's 1907 date, it was a bit of a chicken or egg
          situation at first. Was the farmer inspired by the stone written about
          in the news, or did &Ouml;hman learn the signs from the same source?
          The origin of the Kensington runes has been a bit of a mystery in
          general. As I mentioned, there are many versions of runic alphabets.
          Still, none really match the runes we found on this American piece of
          stone until a few years ago. From a quite surprising source, a middle
          school teacher and her students.

          >
          deciphered runes found in a small Swedish parish called Hassela in the
          northern province of H&auml;lsingland. While the National Heritage
          Board of Sweden received documentation of the Hassela runes back in
          1980, they received little notice until Bj&ouml;rk and her students
          started studying them. With their project, they could shed new light
          on the region's history. Anna Bj&ouml;rk and the kid's efforts were
          celebrated, and the
          <a href="https://www.raa.se/in-english/"
            >Swedish National Heritage Board</a
          >
          awarded them with a medal of merit.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to deciphering the Hassela runes, there was an additional
          twist. The runes used in this parish were identical to those in
          Minnesota. Except these predates &Ouml;hmans discovery of the stones.
          With this information, it did not take long for the veil of the rune's
          origin to fall. Magnus K&auml;llstr&ouml;m, a runologist and associate
          professor at the National Heritage Board, did

          where the Kensington and Hassela runes came from. He was tipped off by
          the regional archive of Medelpad about a memorial plaque with the
          Hassela runes on it and the date 1868. On it, we can read that this
          was created to celebrate the wedding between two people in Latin
          letters. Then we find at the bottom of the plaque a line in Kensington
          runes saying:

          Eric Str&ouml;m was a writing teacher who specialized in offering
          classes to workers, household staff, and servants. He was active in
          the mid-northern part of Sweden. In addition to his teaching,
          Str&ouml;m published a booklet featuring several writing systems,
          including the Hassela runes, which notably include the hooked X found
          on the Kensington Rune Stone (KRS), as well as a pigpen cipher. Later
          copies of these runes, such as those found in the
          <a

        <p>
          Interestingly, there appears to be both an older and a younger version
          of Str&ouml;m's runic alphabet. While Str&ouml;m may not have been the
          original creator, the alphabet cannot date back earlier than the 19th
          century. Evidence suggests that the younger version of Str&ouml;m's
          runes was created after 1880. This conclusion is based on a shift in
          the runic system observed in artifacts like the
          <a

        </p>
        <p>
          The most intriguing part is that the runes on the Kensington Rune
          Stone are written in this younger version of Str&ouml;m's runic
          alphabet!

          Olof &Ouml;hman, as you may recall, emigrated to America. He was born
          in Forsa Parish, located in the H&auml;lsingland province, where the
          influence of Str&ouml;m's runic alphabet would have been prevalent.
          Initially, his surname was Olsson&mdash;a typical Swedish
          name&mdash;but he changed it to &Ouml;hman upon emigrating to the
          United States in 1879.
        </p>
        <p>
          A compelling question arises: Did Olof have any exposure to
          Str&ouml;m's runic alphabet? The answer seems to be yes. His first
          fianc&eacute;e and cousin, Anna Ersdotter, worked as a vallpiga
          (shepherdess) in and around Hassela, an area with strong connections
          to this script. Moreover, the
          <a
            href="https://k-blogg.se/2021/08/03/gastblogg-nya-upptackter-leder-kensingtonrunorna-narmare-olof-ohman/"
            >Olsson family owned land in Kolsj&ouml;n</a
          >, a region within Hassela.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though &Ouml;hman first emigrated in 1879, he returned to Sweden in
          1883, staying for several years before heading back to the U.S. Given
          the deep connections between Hassela and Str&ouml;m's runic alphabet,
          it would almost be surprising if he had not encountered it during this
          period. He likely spent summers in Hassela while the cattle were
          grazing, a common practice then.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />Some authors have tried to portray &Ouml;hman as relatively
          uneducated, but this doesn't seem to hold up under scrutiny. He was
          literate and seemed interested in history and language. One of the
          books &Ouml;hman owned is named "<a
            href="https://runeberg.org/rcskol3/."
            >The kunskapsrike skolm&auml;staren</a
          >" or "The well informed schoolmaster." The book aims to give the
          reader an understanding of everyday topics. One section deals with
          both runes and the medieval language of Sweden. Given his ties to an
          area where Str&ouml;m's script was widely used, it's difficult to
          argue that &Ouml;hman wasn't familiar with the types of runes on the
          stone.
        </p>

        <h2 id="language-age">New or old Swedish?</h2>

          Let's ignore for a moment that the runes used on the stone were
          created in the 1800s. Instead, we will ask if the language used on the
          stone is what we expect to find in Medieval Sweden. Again, the answer
          is no; the language on the stone is not what we see in letters,
          runestones, or books in the 1300s. Mats Larsson points out that what
          we see on the Kensington runestone is a mixture of 1800-Swedish,
          Norwegian, and English. Something that becomes evident if you are
          familiar with the Swedish language. The stone sounds more like

          of Sweden has many written communications preserved from just the
          decade of 1360. Most of these communications are donations or receipts
          of sales or land transfers, but they can still be used to understand
          how Swedes spoke and spelled in 1362. On the website, I've added two
          examples of medieval letters, one from Svealand and one from
          G&ouml;taland, the area where those referred to as G&ouml;ter came
          from.

          A fair point to raise here is that these letters would be written by
          the upper classes. They might not actually reflect how the average Joe
          spoke during this time. Another point is that the letters are not
          written in runes. Luckily, we also have many runic medieval
          inscriptions that we can use. In the G&ouml;taland region, we have 67
          inscriptions with a secure medieval date. None have the Kensington or
          Hassela runes, and none have language similar to that on the KRS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Promoters of the KRS authenticity, like
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Beck_Kehoe"
            >anthropologist Alice Beck Kehoe</a
          >, point out that some of the words are found in the old medieval
          Swedish language. But to get there, they sometimes have to go far
          outside Sweden to find a connection, like the word "from" on line 12.
          To find a connection to medieval Swedish, you have to go to a dialect
          found in the Swedish colony in Estonia on the islands of Nukk and Orm.
          The source is Dr. Richard Nielsen, an engineer, but Kehoe never cited
          the publication or book where this claim is made.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Line two provides the best evidence for the KRS being a modern
          creation. The word "op&thorn;agelsefar&thorn;" is not found in early
          medieval Swedish and would not make sense in this period. Henrik
          Williams points out that the word seems taken from
          <a
            href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:543322/FULLTEXT01.pdfMinneapolis"
            >modern Danish updagelsef&aelig;rd</a
          >. There's no medieval version of the word. The closest we get is the
          word "uptaka" in early medieval Swedish, but the word, in this case,
          would translate to the act of clearing land.
        </p>
        <p>
          That the language on the KRS is a mixture of modern languages isn't
          really something that is debated today among scholars with expertise
          in early medieval Swedish. To be fair, there are critics of this
          conclusion. One we mentioned at the beginning of this is the geologist
          and TV host Scott Wolter, who is maybe one of the most active
          promoters of the stone's authenticity.
        </p>
        <h2 id="hooked-x">The hooked X does not mark the spot</h2>
        <p>
          Now, Wolter claims that linguists and runologists are wrong about the
          stone's language and that it's indeed a 14th-century creation. In his
          book "The Hooked X," he argues that linguists don't see this because
          they have not realized the stone is written in Gotlandic. According to
          Wolter, this misidentification is due to the lack of research on the
          Gotlandic runestones. This rather bold statement ignores the work
          that's been done so far, such as
          <a
            href="https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A161537&amp;dswid=265"
            >Thorgunn Sn&aelig;dal's excellent dissertation</a
          >
          on the Gotlandic language and evolution from 2002. The last part of
          the facsimiles covering the Gotlandic runestones was published with
          their
          <a
            href="https://www.raa.se/kulturarv/runor-och-runstenar/digitala-sveriges-runinskrifter/gotlands-runinskrifter-3/"
            >preliminary findings in 2004</a
          >
          (not 2009, as Wolter claims). These articles also contain previous
          publications of these stones and inscriptions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Wolters's argument here is somewhat flighty. The stone gives us the
          origin of the people mentioned, G&ouml;ter and Norwegians. G&ouml;ter,
          not Goths, are what the people from G&ouml;taland on mainland Sweden
          were called. Gutar is what the people of the island of Gotland are and
          would have been referred to. Wolter also ignores this in his book and
          instead relies on cherry-picking data that fits his conclusion that
          the language is Gothlandic.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Professor Henrik Williams from Uppsala University summarizes why
          Wolter is incorrect<a
            href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:543322/FULLTEXT01.pdfMinneapolis"
          >
            in a 2012 article</a
          >. The typical medieval Gotlandic S rune is missing from the KRS but
          is very common in Gotlandic inscriptions. It's strange that such a
          typical rune is not found on the stone. Williams also points out that
          Gotland kept its diphthongs for a very long time and found them in
          written materials on the island. Again, this is something that is
          missing, along with the Gotlandic case endings on the KRS. So the word
          for a ship on the KRS should be "skipum" and not only "skip."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Wolter also points out that modern Gotlandic dialects often switch the
          a at the end of a word to e. For example, gone or "borta" in Swedish
          is pronounced "borte" in Gotland. On the KRS, we find the word fiske.
          Still, medieval Gotlandic runestones seem to keep the a. Williams uses
          stone
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=cb1d2400-14f9-4f5d-b88d-76bc76ca16ae"
            >G 39</a
          >
          as an example. On top of that, we also have
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=6ef41077-65ec-49e2-b4a2-6cbd0d845b6d"
            >G 255</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=eaf80254-a693-43bc-aea3-28c8ad26a5d5"
            >G 240</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=7edaf3b0-727a-4f8b-b65e-a424e176bbf1"
            >G 393</a
          >, and so on. Then there's the issue: On Gotland, the word stone is
          written as "stain," but on the KRS, it's written as "sten."
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />With all this in mind, the argument that the author of the KRS
          is from 14th-century Gotland is quite obliterated. What's left is the
          dotted R, as Wolter calls them, but if you want to look this up,
          please search for stung runes. On KRS, we do seem to find stung R's.
          While their use on Gotland is intriguing, their appearance on the KRS
          could be explained by reasons other than a Gotlandic connection.
          Wolter also claims to have found a stung R on stone
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=47049894-1d53-4f2e-b171-6a19dbf8fdf5"
            >G 282</a
          >, but here, I have to agree with Thorgunn Sn&aelig;dal that it is a
          <a href="https://www.raa.se/app/uploads/2013/09/16_othem.pdf"
            >result from flaking</a
          >&mdash;not an intentional stung.
        </p>
        <h2 id="numbers-and-runes">Numbers and Runes</h2>
        <p>
          To sum up our findings so far, the text and the runes used don't match
          with what we see in 14th-century Sweden. So, the case for this being
          an authentic medieval runic text becomes less convincing as we
          continue to tally the evidence. Each piece we add to the equation
          seems to subtract from its authenticity. Now, let's shift our focus to
          the numbers engraved on the stone. Much like the language, these
          numerals stand out as anomalies&mdash;elements that don't quite fit
          into the historical equation we're trying to solve.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, the numbers on the stone are written with a sort of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentadic_numerals#"
            >pentadic runes</a
          >. A symbol is used to represent each of the base ten Arabic numerals.
          One looks like an upper case version of the Greek letter Gamma, so
          it's a straight line with a vertical line on the top right side. Then,
          a perpendicular line is added for each number until you reach the
          number five. At five, the symbol looks like an uppercase P. Then a
          vertical line is added for each numeral until you reach the ending on
          9. A vertical line with a circle on top represents 0.

        <p>
          I want to make something extremely clear here: the runic-type numbers
          found on the KRS are not medieval. There's no medieval text or rune
          carving using this type of pentadic numbers. The earliest known
          instance of the use of the KRS numerals is found in the practice sheet
          of Edvard Larsson in 1885. A sheet that also contains a version of the
          KRS or Hassela runes. We will later learn that Scott Wolter claims
          that the KRS was created by Cistercian monks, making these pentadic
          runes even stranger. Would a Cistercian monk not prefer using the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercian_numerals"
            >Cistercian numeral system</a
          >?
        </p>
        <p>
          So, how did you write numbers in Sweden during the early Middle Ages?
          Well, as
          <a
            href="https://spraktidningen.se/artiklar/sifferlos-ristning-kravde-kraft/"
            >Marit &Aring;hlen points out</a
          >, with quite a bit of effort. Numbers were written out in almost all
          cases if Latin numerals were not used. So, if you would like to write
          that something happened in the year 1350, like on the medieval
          Gotlandic runestone
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=9f17f672-c5df-4f2b-a125-866405e28f70"
            >G 293</a
          >, it was quite a mouthful. The author wrote the year on the stone as
          "ett tusen &aring;r och tre hundra &aring;r och femtio &aring;r"/"one
          thousand years, and three hundred years and fifty years." We see the
          same practice in mainland Sweden in
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=0e3c5186-3320-4656-a060-9f6328bd6d54"
            >Sm 114</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=5b3cb599-04fc-41a4-ab98-6801f2309cf3"
            >VG 210</a
          >. It's almost as if the carver were paid by the rune. The same goes
          for the other number on
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=9f17f672-c5df-4f2b-a125-866405e28f70"
            >G 293</a
          >
          referring to the birth of Biblical Adam, which is 5201 years before
          the birth of Christ. Again, the numbers are written out. An exception
          would be in mainland Sweden on stone
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=28a6f89c-6498-4cbb-a5ce-483b38a191ba"
            >DR 366</a
          >, where Latin Numerals were used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same goes for the longest-runic text,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Runicus">Codex Runicus</a
          >. This is a set of laws from Scania written on vellum with runes
          around 1300 CE. The most common practice during this time was simply
          to write out the numbers. Looking back to the Viking age, we find the
          same practice of writing numerals as text. We still see this practice
          in the Swedish medieval letters from this period. The only difference
          is that Latin numerals are a bit more common, but if the Latin numbers
          aren't used, then the year, amount of money, etc is written out. What
          we learn here is that if you find yourself back in time working as a
          scribe, make sure to charge per letter.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With that said, there are cases where runes were used to symbolize
          numbers in a way. These can be found in the Scandinavian version of
          the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_of_Easter">Easter Table</a
          >, a computation method developed in the Catholic Church to know when
          Easter was supposed to be celebrated. But also keep track of other
          celebrations or events you must participate in during the year. So,
          it's a sort of calendar where the runes are used as arbitrary symbols,
          not really numbers in that sense. The majority of these types of
          Perpetual calendars in Sweden are
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runic_calendar"
            >wooden staffs</a
          >. An alternative version can also be found in a table format often
          referred to in Sweden as an Easter Table with 19 columns and 28 rows.
          The earliest known versions of the runic calendars are from the 14th
          century. However, the vast majority of the almanacs we have preserved
          are from the 1500s and later.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <figure class="rounded" style="width: 40%; margin-left: 10px">
            <img

          </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
          The staff consists of golden numbers, in this case, the younger
          futhark with three runes invented for this computation device,
          representing the 19-year moon cycle. It takes about 19 years for the
          new moon to appear on the same day again. Then, the first seven runes
          are repeated 52 times to represent the weeks of the year. The crux
          here is that to use the runestaf or the Easter Table, you must know
          the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_number_(time)"
            >Golden Year</a
          >
          and the Dominical (or Sunday) letter. If you have these two, you can
          calculate when Easter should occur. The upside with the table
          computation is that you can refer to a year within the Easter Table
          using The Golden Year and the Sunday letter. Another bonus is that
          this chart covers 532 years, allowing people to refer to a year
          between 1140 and 1671 covered by this version.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a few examples of medieval rune inscriptions where the texts
          indeed refer to the Easter Tablet. For example, stone
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=3845fdd5-8fe2-4316-97e8-8e3a756b72bf"
            >G 171</a
          >
          commemorates a church fire in Hejde. In the last line, we can read,
          "Then H was the Sunday[-stave] and S the prime-stave in the thirteenth
          row." If we go to the Easter Table and look for the S rune in the 13th
          column on the line with a H rune, we can learn the year of the fire.
          1492 was the year when the flames were destroying parts of the
          building. Another example of the use of the Easter Table is on
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=65378c2e-f818-426e-8a72-6e5f7df61278"
            >G 78</a
          >, which tells us when a house remodeling was completed; in this case,
          it was "And then H was the Sunday[-stave] and K &hellip; in the
          thirteenth row." If we look at our chart, we can see that the kitchen
          renovation was completed in 1478. Every reference to the Easter Table
          follows this formula: we get the Sunday letter, the prime (or golden)
          number, and then what column to ensure we get the correct year.
        </p>
        <p>
          In "The Hooked X," Wolter claims that there are secret codes hidden on
          the KRS. One is supposedly a repetition of the year 1362. Wolter
          mentions that by using the U-rune to the left side in line 9 with the
          L rune on line 4 (except it's on line 3) combined with the pentadic
          rune 8, we get the year 1362 on the Easter Table. One of Wolters'
          claims regarding KRS is that it was a land claim. So, the authors
          feared that someone would alter the year of the claim by changing the
          pentadic numeral, moving the date of the claim to another century. A
          huge flaw, as you might see, is that pentadic runes where not used.
          Also, it is much harder to change a date that&rsquo;s written out in
          text, and if you add the reference to the easter table, it would be
          basically impossible to change it without destroying the stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          To support this idea of repeated dates in Medieval Sweden, and
          especially Gotland Wolter, refers to two stones with the designation
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=88844450-4476-4528-bc8e-88746c514f9b"
            >G 99</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://app.raa.se/open/runor/inscription?id=dcb50477-e450-4684-9dfc-178255a60fd6"
            >G 100</a
          >. The unfortunate reality here is that it's only G 99 that has dual
          dates. First as "fourteen hundred years and one year less than fifty
          years" and then "in that year K was the prime-stave and R the
          Sunday[-stave] in the {eleventh} row." In fact, G 99 is the only stone
          we have with a repetition of the year. Note here that the carver uses
          the same formula we see on every other inscription we have. You can
          also check my work on this since the Swedish National Heritage Board
          offers a searchable service of all known inscriptions found to date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another issue with Wolters's claim is the use of the version of the
          KRS U-rune. All runestones on Gotland use the U-rune found in the
          futhark. So it would be quite odd that people trained in a Gotlandic
          setting would suddenly differ on key runes used during these periods.
          But as we already covered, the Hassela script is an 1800 creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sum of all this is that the KRS differs significantly from the
          material found on mainland Sweden and Gotland during the 14th century.
          The use of Larsson's pentadic runes is another thing that points to a
          19th-century creation of the KRS. That we suddenly find a stone that
          differs so much from all known material is a crucial indicator it was
          created much later in history. I also want to point out that the book
          we found in &Ouml;hmans possessions also has a section on the old
          calendars. The Easter Tablet has also been in different prints since
          at least
          <a
            href="https://books.google.se/books/content?id=uv5XAAAAcAAJ&amp;hl=sv&amp;pg=PT8&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U3woAAyUZ3XJ9jm0PRxPlcy_IA08w&amp;ci=2%2C19%2C988%2C1595&amp;edge=0"
            >1626 when Ole Worm</a
          >
          published a copy of this chart. Runic calendars were also commonly
          used in the area from where &Ouml;hman originates. So, both the use
          and the calculation of dates are well within reason to have been
          understood and utilized by Olof &Ouml;hman or someone cooperating with
          him.

        <h2 id="archaeology">Kensington Runestone and Archaeology</h2>
        <p>
          How about we shift a little and look at the archaeological aspects and
          findings regarding the stone? Are there any? The answer is an immense
          no. Professor Feder points out in his book
          <a
            href="https://www.amazon.com/Archaeological-Oddities-Civilizations-Ancient-Visitors/dp/1538105969"
            >Archaeological Oddities</a
          >
          that there isn't a single archaeological trace of Scandinavians in
          Minnesota during the 1300s. There are no signs of camps, trash, lost
          items, or anything connected to a Swedish or Norwegian medieval
          explorer. From an archaeological perspective, we know that this is
          undoubtedly an archaeological oddity. Finds of the Viking's presence
          in northern Canada can be found throughout the area where the
          short-lived settlement was.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lack of Scandinavian artifacts in the area isn't due to a lack of
          trying either. Feder mentions excavations that have been done in 1899
          and 1964 in the area where the stone was found.
          <a
            href="https://archive.org/details/kensingtonrunest0000keho/page/22/mode/2up"
            >Kehoe mentions in her book</a
          >
          that further tests and surveys were carried out in 1981 and 2001. You
          might argue that a small encampment would not appear or be found, but
          that's not true. Archaeologists do find nomadic temporary encampments
          all the time. Specifically, there are fire hearths, but there is also
          a large amount of trash humans have been leaving behind since the dawn
          of time. If you hike in northern Sweden and know what to look for, you
          can find these temporary encampments in the landscape today.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It is just not possible that a party of 30 people would come to an
          area and not leave a single item behind or create a single hearth.
          Since they took the time to carve a whole slab of stone full of runes,
          they strongly talk against the ninja-trained Scandinavian.

          cremated the bodies, archaeological evidence would have been left
          behind. Some suggest that the dead were Native Americans attacking.
          Still, even then, it would have been good practice to at least put
          together a mass grave. As seen in the aftermath of the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Visby"
            >Battle of Visby</a
          >

        <p>
          It might be a bit surprising to learn that Alice Kehoe is a respected
          anthropologist. Especially since she promotes the idea that the KRS is
          a genuine 14th-century artifact to this day. As recently as 2016, she
          proposed the stone as authentic, ignoring the things that don't fit,
          relying heavily on outdated information or faulty assumptions that we
          have already covered. Remember that a degree doesn't necessarily
          protect you against bad ideas if critical thinking is not applied. You
          might counter here that the stories about Vinland were considered
          fiction. The key difference here is that Newfoundland turned out to
          have real artifacts, proving that Vikings visited the area briefly.
          We're not talking about some century-long occupation; we're talking
          about a settlement lasting for maybe a few decades at most.

        <h2 id="geology">Geology of the Kensington Runestone</h2>
        <p>
          Now we come to an area where Scott Wolter could have me beat: the
          stones' geology. I could add a
          <a href="https://www.jasoncolavito.com/scott-wolter-lawsuit.html"
            >quip regarding agates</a
          >
          here, but I'll refrain. I'm not a geologist, but luckily, I have a
          couple of geology experts around me.
        </p>
        <p>
          One part of Wolters' and others' arguments that the stone is authentic
          is based on the idea that the weathering proves the stone to be of the
          proper age. However, as geoarchaeologist
          <a href="https://twitter.com/SoilManDan">Dan Fallu</a> told me in a
          personal communication (twitter), "Weathering has no universal
          constant rate. It varies with pH, temperature, moisture, energy
          regime, and mineralogy. Even when you restrict the mineralogy, you
          still have every other issue." Depending on the environmental
          conditions, you could try to use soil weathering or clay formations,
          but this would be highly uncertain on an object already removed from
          the soil.

            >Harold Edwards's 2020</a
          >
          paper for a more in-depth breakdown of the geological claims regarding
          the Kensington runestone. Anthropologist Andy White wrote a fine post
          discussing the calcite weathering found in the bottom left corner of
          the KRS, with input from Edwards.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Scott Wolters geological claims about the Kennsington
          Runestone, they can be summed up in two points.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wolters first piece of geological evidence compares the pyrite in the
          KRS and the confirmed hoax called the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVM_Runestone">AVM runestone</a
          >, a granite gneiss bolder with runes created in 1985. Wolter claims
          that this comparison shows that the KRS stone must have been made 20
          years before Olof &Ouml;hman discovered the stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, Scott Wolter also compared biotite found in the KRS with
          gravestones in Maine. Wolter claims that this comparison shows that
          the KRS is much older than 200 years due to the weathering of the Mica
          minerals.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Michlovic raised several concerns regarding this comparison. Other
          geologists have also determined that the comparison between different
          rocks is questionable. I even raised an eyebrow regarding this
          statement. A tombstone in coastal Maine would have quite a different
          weather and climate than Minnesota in the central US. Why Wolter chose
          this comparison is unclear. Wolter also uses a minimal sample size on
          top of all this. In his first comparison, we have one stone of a
          different type. In the second, he bases his analysis on only three
          stones. It might be interesting if the tests were based on more slabs
          and within the same environment. A cause for concern here, however, is
          that nobody else seems to use this method of dating carvings on stone.
          It would be amazing to have a way of creating an absolute dating of a
          carved object in stone. The lack of people pursuing this method might
          indicate that it does not work as hoped.
        </p>
        <h2 id="riverkings">River kings without rivers</h2>
        <p>
          Another glaring issue with the stone is its location. We learned on
          the stone that the medieval explorers were 14 days from the coast. But
          Solem in Douglas County, where the rock was found, is very far from
          any coast. When &Ouml;hman supposedly found the KRS, ships could take
          the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal">Erie Canal</a> to
          travel between the Atlantic and the Great Lakes. But this route
          definitely didn't exist in the 14th century. This means the explorers
          would have had to push the ships over land for quite a bit or travel
          solely on foot, a journey definitely more than 14 days. Both
          operations would have been an undertaking that would have left
          evidence of their visit. As shown in Europe along the river tradeways,
          the Vikings operated in the 11th century. So, while the text makes
          sense in the 19th century, this would not have been the case in the
          14th.
        </p>
        <h2 id="templars">Here Come the Templars</h2>
        <p>
          But why was the Kensington Runestone created? Let's deal with the more
          imaginative version first, and then I'll get to the more grounded
          version. According to Richard Nielsen and Scott Wolter, the Kensington
          Runestone was created as part of a land claim but, most importantly,
          by the Templars. Yes, those Templars and, of course, the holy Grail
          seem to be involved.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you remember when I mentioned a hidden code when discussing the
          numerals? Well, according to Wolter's 2009 book, there is another. By
          using a microscope, Wolter claims to have seen hidden punchmarks and
          strokes on certain characters. You can get the following sentence by
          adding these characters together, according to Richard Nielsen.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="text-center">
          <blockquote class="blockquote">

        </figure>

        <p>
          The issue with this supposed hidden code is that it builds on Nielsens
          and Wolters assumptions, attempted translations and subjective
          symbolism. Could there be a hidden message on the stone? Sure, why
          not? But this sentence does not prove that the stone is from the 14th
          century. I looked at a recent
          <a href="https://www.artec3d.com/3d-models/kensington-runestone"
            >high-resolution 3D</a
          >
          scan of the stone and could not see these markings. Maybe they are
          there, perhaps they aren't. Scott is welcome to publish more details
          about them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Wolter is trying to present the idea that the Knights Templars went to
          the US, maybe to hide the Grail or Jesus' bloodline, and have since
          acted as the man behind the curtain. But how does the island of
          Gotland fit in? According to Wolters, the Templars had a base
          there&mdash;or at least a connection through the Cistercian Monastery
          operating on the island. In "The Hooked X," Wolter speculates that a
          Cistercian monk from Gotland created the KRS.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          You might wonder why the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cistercians">Cistercians</a>
          and Templars are connected to the grail idea. It all goes back to
          Arthurian legends, especially the work Prose Lancelot. In "Queste del
          Saint Graal," we get the beginnings of the legends about the Holy
          Grail. This particular story seems to have been influenced by
          Cistercian ideals and values that would later influence the Templars.
          For a more in-depth exploration of this, I recommend reading
          <a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/84625/">Karen Pratt&rsquo;s</a>
          and
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11061-007-9050-3"
            >Marco Nievergelt's</a
          >
          articles on the topic. Something interesting here to note is that
          according to
          <a
            href="https://brill.com/display/book/9789004622722/B9789004622722_s026.xml"
            >Stephen Knight</a
          >, the rise of Arthurian romance works can be connected to a decline
          in the population's enthusiasm regarding the Crusades. So, in a sense,
          the legends about the Grail could be viewed as a propaganda tool to
          promote the Crusades.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might also be good to mention that
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_of_Clairvaux"
            >Bernard of Clairvaux</a
          >, the founder of the Cistercians, was a driving force behind the
          Second Crusade and a co-founder of the Knights Templar order. While
          Bernard was involved in creating these two orders, it's worth pointing
          out that they were completely separate orders. Wolter, however, seems
          to use them interchangeably throughout his book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cistercians indeed had a large
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roma_Abbey"
            >Monastery in Roma</a
          >
          on Gotland. However, the order had several monasteries in Sweden with
          stronger ties to both Clairvaux and the mother cloister. Sure, the
          monks in Roma would acquire large pieces of land later and, through
          money, grow in importance. As far as we know, the monks in Roma never
          went to America or seemed to be hiding any grails.

        <p>
          To support his claim that the Templars and Cistercians controlled the
          religious life on Gotland, Wolter claims that the churches have
          Templar Crosses in them. The issue with that claim is that Wolter has
          confused the Templar Cross with a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration_cross"
            >Consecration Cross</a
          >. These can often be found in medieval churches, where the bishop
          spreads holy water during the consecration and consists of a cross
          within a circle. Wolter also misidentifies a painting of Saint Peter
          for Bernard of Clairvaux in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A4rbro_Church"
            >L&auml;rbro parish church</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick lament on my part: Wolter claims that there are six defense
          towers on Gotland. This is
          <a href="https://www.guteinfo.com/?avd=59&amp;ord=Kastaler"
            >incorrect</a
          >;
          <a
            href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1453773/FULLTEXT01.pdf"
            >there are nine confirmed defense towers</a
          >
          and an additional nine, depending on how you define the structure's
          name within the Swedish language. On top of that, we have records of
          five more towers but no hard evidence of their existence today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wolter also claims that the Teutonic Knights were active in Gotland
          and part of the KRS expedition. This order is again separate from the
          Knights Templars, founded by German merchants to support the war in
          the Holy Land. After the defeat in Acre, the order would later form an
          independent state in Poland. So, while the order was active in the
          Baltic area, they were not present in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Gotland_(1398)"
            >Gotland until 1398</a
          >, when they invaded the island to protect merchants from pirate
          activity. The island was under Teutonic control until 1408 when it was
          returned to the Kalmar Union. So, the orders activity does not fit
          with Wolter's claims nor the date of 1362 found on the stone.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Why and Who?</h2>
        <p>
          So, considering all this, it's hard to make an argument that the stone
          is from the 14th century. Everything we have found points to a modern
          date. So who made it? Most likely, Olof &Ouml;hman, but he might not
          have been alone. Two more persons can be connected to Olof &Ouml;hman
          and the stone, defrocked priest Sven Fogelblad and John P Gran. All
          immigrants from Sweden. In
          <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20178443"
            >1967, in an interview</a
          >
          later transcribed by the Minnesota Historical Society, Gran's children
          would admit that their father, together with &Ouml;hman and Fogleblad,
          created the stone. A strange accusation if there was no truth to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth remembering that the creation of the KRS would not have been
          long after the National Romance and fascination of the Vikings in
          Sweden. Societies were created to promote the manly ideas of the brave
          exploring Vikings. A Viking Revival took place across Europe and the
          US. Books like Fritiof Saga by the Swedish author Tegner and other
          books were published and popular. Claims of Vinland really being
          America and that Scandinavians arrived here before Columbus was
          theorized by Professor Rasmus B. Anderson and Gustav Storm. The latter
          writings can be found in Swedish newspapers in the US. The creation
          would also have coincided with the World Fair in Chicago, celebrating
          the 400th anniversary of Columbus arriving in America. So, there were
          a lot of Vikings on a lot of people's minds during this period.

          According to the children of John Gran, &Ouml;hman and the others seem
          to have thought it was a great time to create a prank. Maybe even fool
          those who were more educated.

          makes a connection between the KRS and the Dakota War of 1862. It
          would have taken place almost next to where &Ouml;hman would come to
          live a few decades later and most likely would have been an event in
          people's minds still. Feagan writes that the dates' similarity could
          be a slight nod to the war if the stone is a hoax.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, in light of all this, the stone has played a more important role
          in modern history. In a way, the stone is more important as a
          reflection of American identity and how history is viewed when
          arriving in a new country. The stone can also be looked at in how it's
          been displayed in museums and what values and ideas it represents. Is
          it about the migration of people, or is it representing the founding
          of the US? So, while it might not be authentic, it can still serve as
          a way for us to explore history. Even if the events are closer in
          time.
