        <p>
          You might have seen this story on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok,
          Twitter, or any other social media site. It's a post accompanied by
          several old-timey-looking pictures and a text telling of the great
          explorer Alfred Isaac Midleton going something like this:
        </p>

          "<em
            >British explorer Alfred Isaac Midleton (Or Middleton) traveled the
            farthest reaches of the globe during the late 19th century in search

            unearthed photographs help to shed light on some of his amazing
            discoveries during several missions to then-uncharted regions of
            Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;</em

            expedition to uncover the fabled Lost City of Dawleetoo. Due to
            these tragic events, scant details are known about what you see in
            these fascinating photos.</em

          The character's name is a clue to the story's origin, A.I. Middleton.
          Add the city <em>Dawleetoo, </em>a play on Dall-e II, and the story's
          source looks quite straightforward. The author has been quite clever
          when constructing the narrative. Middleton was the name of an
          archaeologist and museum director during 1800; his full name was John
          Henry Middleton. An
          <a href="http://middletonas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >archaeological society</a
          >
          was named after him in 2011. That the name resembles a real person
          makes the story more believable.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure
          class="rounded float-start"
          style="width: 15%; margin-right: 10px"

          <img
            src="img/PercyFawcettHead.jpg"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt="Portrait of Percy Fawcett"
          />
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">

        </figure>
        <p>
          Add then that the main story is based on the life of Percy Fawcett,
          who got lost when searching for a lost city in Brazil. The location of
          which is described in a document is usually referred to as Manuscript
          512. This document of dubious origin describes the journey of a couple
          of slavers in early colonial Brazil. One day one of the unnamed
          slavers stumbled across a city with what looked like Roman triumphant
          arches and obelisks. The group didn't find much except one gold coin
          in the city. Several attempts to find this anachronistic roman looking
          town have been made, and today, most think this story to be a
          fabrication.

        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 20%; margin-left: 10px">
          <img
            src="img/295671629_5727010003975883_8555372138427692860_n.jpg"

          But the manuscript has inspired other works of fiction, maybe most
          notably Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel "<a
            href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/arthur-conan-doyle/the-lost-world"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>The lost city</em></a
          ><em>.</em>" Doyle also appears in some of the stories about A.I.
          Middleton as the curator of Middleton's account. I also think it might
          be good to highlight that Percy Fawcett might be the inspiration for
          Indiana Jones. Note the resemblance between Fawcett and this picture
          claimed to be of A.I. Middleton.

          Sensationalistic blogs like "<em>Lost Books</em>" and "<em
            >Mysteries unsolved</em
          >" has also invented a source in the shape of a book they in the text
          refer to as "<em>The Lost Casket of Dawleetoo.</em>" As you might
          suspect, this book is also a semi-true invention. The
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >book is named "<em>The lost casket</em>"</a

          and was written by a

            href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/authors/search/?query=Du+Boisgobey,+Fortun%c3%a9"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >French author Fortun&eacute; du Boisgobey</a
          >, and published in 1881. It does not contain Middleton, gold statues,
          Dawleetoo, or anything connected to this story.

          If we look at the pictures, we see artifacts typical of AI-generated
          images. These artifacts are most visible in the photographs depicting
          people. Even if AI has come a long way, it still struggles with
          rendering naturally-looking humans. We also see that most photos are
          based on depictions of space shuttles.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As AI imaging becomes increasingly advanced, it becomes essential to
          analyze stories critically. Who is the source, and how does the story
          hold up when examined? Overall, the dangers of AI-generated images
          highlight the importance of being cautious when evaluating the
          authenticity and reliability of any photos we encounter and taking
          steps to protect ourselves from potential abuse or misuse of this
          technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some will try to use it to spread misinformation, and we need to
          prepare ourselves for this. We should not forget this technology's
          usefulness and possibilities in our research and when trying to
          picture how an archaeological site looked, for example.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, how much of this text was made with AI? Want to take a guess?
