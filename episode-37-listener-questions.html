          This time the listener's questions and comments are in the spotlight!
          I have opened up the giant bag of electronic communications and will
          take some time to answer some of the questions and comments from you,
          the listener.
        </p>
        <p>
          The questions ranged from dangers during excavations, melted stones,
          and Ancient Egyptian Wi-FI. I also have an update on a previous story
          we covered solving a claim's true origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 37. This time things are
          going to be a little bit different. Questions and comments have come
          in throughout the show; this episode will address some of these. If
          you have written a question or comment that's not covered here, don't
          worry. It will likely be in a future episode. This time, the questions
          will cover various topics and locations ranging from South America to
          Egypt. Some will be personal, while others will be about
          pseudo-archaeological topics such as melted stones or ancient Egyptian
          Wi-Fi. What we do miss is a correction, but I have an update on a
          story I did cover some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a comment or question, the best way to get it to me is by
          email. The contact info can be found on diggingupancientaliens.com,
          together with the references for each episode. If email is not your
          thing, don't worry. I can usually be found in the comment section on
          the posts made on social media.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I also try to read the reviews you leave, so if you like the podcast,
          I would appreciate it if you left one of those fancy five-star reviews
          I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>But with that out of the way, let's dig into the episode!</p>
        <h3 id="meltedstone">Tambomachay</h3>
        <p>
          I got a question from listener David who wrote me asking, "Would you
          please comment on what appears to be melted stone work at this site in
          Peru and what might have done the damage? I know it wasn't a UFO that
          did it!"&nbsp;

        </figure>
        <p>
          With the question, I got a picture of an Inka water fountain at the
          site of Tambomachay. The fountain itself isn't quite small with
          traditional Inka masonry in a Cellular polygonal style. Meaning we
          have stones with different shape and form fitted together. We have
          seen more elaborate fountains in Ollantaytambo, for example. A site we
          covered in episode 29, titled Aliens and Ancient Engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tambomachay is not far from the city of Cusco and contains a lot of
          different waterworks. We find aqueducts, springs, and fountains here.
          The actual function of the place is a bit unclear, and it can be
          speculated that it was a noble retreat, a water temple, or a
          combination of several things. What is impressive is that many of the
          fountains still work today.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To get back to Davids's question, I thought he meant a set of rocks to
          the left of the fountains. Due to the size of the picture, this part
          had a wet sheen, which added to the melted effect I perceived. But the
          stone is not melted, of course. By looking at other pictures and
          comparing, it's evident that the stone has suffered from pitting and
          erosion from the elements. David also had realized this, but we looked
          at a different spot. He was talking about another section of the
          stoneworks that was also a part where the natural rock. It seems as if
          the Inka builders, to save time, had incorporated some features of the
          natural outcroppings. But it turns out that these sections were of
          lower quality than the stones brought in from elsewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is quite a good exercise in how the pareidolia effect work. If
          instructed to find an anomaly, we are more likely to see one, even if
          it does not exist. That's why people selling pseudoscience usually
          point out what you should look for and where to ensure you will see
          this. If you would just get a picture where the melted stone is not
          pointed out, you're likelier to not see it and write this off. So
          thank you, David, for this great reminder!
        </p>
        <h3 id="wifi">Wi-Fi in Ancient Egypt?</h3>
        <p>
          Then we have a question that took a bit longer than anticipated to
          answer and led me down a rabbit hole of Ptolemaic art, Egyptian
          perfume making, and barbeque.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It all started with an account called Transition Cat sending me a
          video from an Instagram creator named Billy Carson. We have not
          encountered Billy within the Ancient Alien context, but he seems to
          put himself in between ET and lost civilizations. Carson is behind a
          pseudoscience streaming network named 4biddenknowledge INC. and been a
          talking head on shows like Ancient Civilizations on Gaia. A show we
          will get to one of these days. Gaia is quite prolific in their quest
          to spread humbug.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Billy Carson has the tells of a quack, and it becomes apparent in the
          video that he is not above making things up. In the video, we can hear
          him make the following claim.
        </p>
        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 10px">
          <img

            class="img-fluid"

          <figcaption class="figure-caption">

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          "As a matter of fact, when you go into the Temple of Horus in Egypt,
          there's a depiction of something that's really amazing. It's the Wi-Fi
          symbol emanating a frequency out of an Egyptian person's hand, showing
          that they had the capability of understanding frequencies through
          wireless technology." - Billy Carson 4biddenknowledge
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video, we see a depiction of a man holding a jar and what looks
          like the Wi-Fi symbol in the other but with dots between each line. My
          initial thought was that it was some sort of drying rack. Now Ancient
          Egyptian art is not my specialty, but I did my best. After some more
          research, it kind of looked as if it could be a depiction of the
          "essence of incense." But that answer never sat well with me, so I
          continued to look.
        </p>
        <p>
          The depiction is located within the Temple of Horus in Edfu. This
          temple is usually just referred to as the Edfu Temple if you go
          online. It's located between Aswan and Luxor in a town today known as
          Edfu; the Ancient Egyptians called this place Djeba. The temple sits
          on an older temple. Unfortunately, not much is known about the earlier
          temple, and one of the few things preserved is a naos-type shrine from
          the last native Egyptian Pharao Nectanebo II. A Naos shrine is a
          rectangular box with an opening, often for a statue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Temple of Horus is one of the best-preserved ancient Egyptian
          sites. Thanks to its state of preservation, we have a wealth of
          information about the temple and the people who built it, including
          their own words inscribed on its walls. We can learn a great deal
          about how they constructed the temple and the different rituals within
          the walls. The construction was first started by Ptolemy III in 237
          BCE and would take 180 years. The final addition to the temple was
          made by Cleopatra VII (the famous Cleopatra) father, Ptolemy XII, and
          was finished in 57 BCE.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If we would stroll towards the temple, we would be met by two statues
          of Horus as a falcon on each side of the entrance. Behind them are the
          large entrance pylon, consisting of two decorated towers. We already
          see that the Ptolomeic art style differs from the classic era. Of
          course, there are traditional elements, such as Ptolemy XII smiting
          his enemies with a mace. We also see a scene called "Feast of the
          Beautiful Meeting," in which Horus of Edfu is united with Hathor of
          Dendera. After passing the pylons, we enter a peristyle courtyard,
          showing the Greek influences in the temple. This yard is open to the
          sun in the center, with 32 columns supporting a short roof on the
          sides. On the walls, we find several foundational texts within
          Egyptian mythology; possibly most noteworthy among them is Horus
          defeating the evil Seth. After this defeat, Horus takes his place as
          the ruler of Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will get to two Hypostyle halls if we continue into the temple.
          Hypostyle means that the room has several columns that support the
          roof of the building. As we make our way towards the holy of holy,
          there will be darker and darker. We are then getting into the Offering
          Hall, where we can see the rites of the divine offerings and the
          actions that were supposed to occur. A table was most likely here to
          prepare the offerings to Horus and the other gods in the temple. We
          will return to this room momentarily since this is the key to our
          Wi-Fi symbol.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To the west and east in this room, we find stairs symbolizing the
          sun's rising and setting. The god climbed the eastern staircase during
          the new year to see his sun disk and unite with his ba. He would later
          descend the western stairs satisfied after taking his place at the
          temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further in, we find the sanctuary where Horus's image would reside and
          more rooms for storage. One of them is referred to as a laboratory or
          Lord of the Ointments workshop. Within this room, we find descriptions
          of offerings of oils, perfumes, and incense to the gods. We even find
          depictions of the pharao offering natron, one of the mummification's
          main ingredients. Almost all the offerings are made by Ptolemy VI to
          various gods. While the temple is mainly dedicated to Horus, the other
          gods were still honored here. We also find two recipes written on the
          walls of this room for a substance the Egyptians called Kapet.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Kapet was mainly used as a sort of incense and is presumably one of
          the most famous prepared fragrances in Ancient Egypt. The oldest
          mention of this preparation is in the pyramid text from Pharao Unas in
          the fifth dynasty. While our preserved recipes are few and younger,
          this is an old and vital tradition in Ancient Egypt. In most of the
          literature, Kapet will be referred to as the Greek translation Kyphi.
          The word itself could be translated to a substance used in fumigation,
          a substance to be burnt, or a scent. Kapet could also be used not as
          incense but as a remedy for a myriad of illnesses.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The two recipes we find in the room are basically the same; the
          difference lies in the quantities and the names of the substances. One
          is called "Recipe for the preparation of excellent kyphi for divine
          use" and contains more illustrative terms than its alternative
          version. The one for divine use includes more of the expensive items
          compared to the just "excellent kyphi." If you want to create your
          own, you need the following ingredients.

          Mix and light on fire to please the gods. But what does all of this
          have to do with the Wi-Fi symbol? Don't worry, I'll come to this now.
          If we go online and try to find this symbol, the sources will claim
          that it is located within the perfume laboratory. So I've spent much
          time reviewing the different registers and reliefs within this room.
          I've read up on Egyptian perfume and incense making but nowhere could
          I find this symbol. Realizing I'd hit a dead end, I went back, trying
          to figure out where the scene could be found within the temple.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at some tourist videos, I managed to find out that the scene
          was located within the offering room we mentioned earlier. At this
          point, I reached out to Annelise Baer, who creates a lot of excellent
          videos on Ancient Egypt and other topics over on TikTok. We found Dr.
          Carina van den Hoven, who did her dissertation on "The coronation
          ritual of the Falcon at Edfu." This seems to be a fascinating book
          regarding the function and composition of ritual texts within
          Ptolemaic Egypt. It's supposed to be published later this year, and if
          you're into Egyptology, this seems to be a great read.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. van den Hoven was kind enough to help me further, and I finally
          could find out what this was. The scene is described in &Eacute;mile
          Chassinat's Le Temple d'Edfou, vol. IX, on plate XXXV(35)b, published
          in 1929. It turns out the Wi-Fi symbol can be found on each side of
          the door on the southern wall, and you can also spot it on the eastern
          wall in another offering scene.&nbsp;
        </p>

          If you know how to read hieroglyphs and ancient Egyptian, you will
          learn that the accompanied text talks about how the gods are offered
          meat and fat from butchered animals. With this in mind, we can go to
          Gardiner's sign list and look up sign F43, the sign for the Egyptian
          word sHpt. Translate this to English, and we get the word ribs. So the
          gods get an offering of a jar of animal fat and a cut of meat, in this
          case, ribs. Whether or not they were barbequed and honey-glazed is not
          evident from the text.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the ancient Egyptians did not have Wi-Fi, and this story shows the
          importance of experts like Annelise Baer and Dr. Carina van den Hoven.
          While you can read up on things, nothing ultimately beats the true
          experts in their fields. As for Carson's claims, they are clearly spun
          out of thin air.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not the first time we actually encountered this temple.
          Another scene in the temple is claimed by Derek Olson from megalithic
          marvels to depict levitation in Ancient Egypt. For more about that,
          you should head to YouTube, where I publish some extra stuff.
          Megalithic Marvels and Derek Olson are posting a lot of different
          pseudo-scientific claims and selling overpriced tours of
          misinformation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But there we have it, and I'm sorry, Transition Cat, for the delayed
          answer. But we did manage to find what it was in the end.

        <h3 id="hancock">Graham Hancock</h3>
        <p>
          Listener Torfinn wrote as a comment to our episode about Graham
          Hancocks Netflix series. Torfinn wrote, "Did he get it wrong? Or did
          he just lie? Never attribute to ignorance what can better be
          attributed to greed."
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a question I wrestle with myself, should we accuse these
          fringe authors of being liars and peddlers of disinformation? I'm
          unsure and go back and forth on it. Calling someone a liar will put
          this person in a defensive stance, making reaching them harder. The
          end goal is not for them to continue writing these fringe stories. The
          end goal is that they see reason and the errors in their past ideas.
          Michel Marshall, editor of the Skeptic magazine UK and host of Be
          Reasonable, has an excellent approach. I've also discussed the concept
          of pedagogy of luck with Aron Rabinowitz back in episode 26, where the
          idea is that we should use compassion and empathy to change people's
          minds. Mainly because not everyone has had the luck of having the
          education and access to the information we have.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is a question without black-and-white answers. The best
          approach is not yet found, as far as I know. We should also note that
          it varies from person to person. The journey to leave pseudoscience is
          long and will differ, just as a person going from religion to atheism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feel free to message me with your opinion or experience on the matter.
          I'm happy to hear from you all.
        </p>
        <p>
          So my position is a bit in between. As long we don't have evidence
          that they are lying and intentionally spreading disinformation, we
          should be kinder. Some of the writers are true believers that have
          been hoodwinked themselves. But when we know that they are actively
          deceiving while not believing, we should definitely go after them
          harder.&nbsp;

        <h3>Dangers during excavations</h3>
        <h3 id="middleton">&nbsp;Alfred Isaac Middleton</h3>
        <p>
          This next section is not a question but a case where additional
          information has been found. A while back, I did a YouTube video called
          "Alfred Isaac Midleton - the greatest explorer that never existed." If
          you have watched that clip, don't worry. We will not repeat it but
          give an extended version of it. I have uncovered some new details of
          the story's origin that interest you all.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's talk about AI-generated images and stories. You might have seen
          a recent report on social media accompanied by old-timey pictures of
          the great explorer Alfred Isaac Middleton. The spelling varies with
          one or two "D" in the last name. These pictures are usually
          accompanied by a story that goes something like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          "British explorer Alfred Isaac Midleton (Or Middleton) traveled the
          farthest reaches of the globe during the late 19th century in search
          of zoological, botanical, and archeological wonders. These recently
          unearthed photographs help to shed light on some of his amazing
          discoveries during several missions to then-uncharted regions of
          Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Amazon rainforest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 15%; margin-left: 10px">
          <img
            src="img/06.jpg"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt="AI generated picture of the fake city Dawleetoo"
          />
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            <p>Some claim this is Dawleetoo</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, all of his journals and scientific writings were lost
          in 1901 when Midleton and his team vanished during a Sumatran
          expedition to uncover the fabled Lost City of Dawleetoo. Due to these
          tragic events, scant details are known about what you see in these
          fascinating photos."
        </p>
        <p>
          Picture this: a mysterious story with clues hidden in plain sight. It
          starts with the protagonist's name, A.I. Middleton, which seems
          innocent enough. But take a closer look; you'll see it's a clue to the
          story's origin. Artificial Intelligence Middleton. Add in the city of
          Dawleetoo, a play on the name of Dall-e II, and suddenly the mystery
          deepens.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the author doesn't stop there. The story's construction is
          downright clever. You see, Middleton wasn't just any name plucked from
          thin air. It was the name of a real-life archaeologist and museum
          director during the 1800s. John Henry Middleton, to be exact. And get
          this: in 2011, an archaeological society was named after him. It's
          almost as if the author is trying to make the story more believable by
          using a name that resembles a genuine person.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's little details like these that make this story so intriguing. Who
          knows what other secrets are waiting to be uncovered?
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the stories seem inspired by the adventurer Percy Fawcett, who
          we will get to in a moment, and a document called "Manuscript 512."
          The document's real name is "Rela&ccedil;&atilde;o hist&oacute;rica de
          huma oculta, e grande Povoa&ccedil;&atilde;o, antiguissima sem
          moradores, que se descubrio no anno de 1753" or in English,
          "Historical relation of an occult, large, very old settlement with no
          inhabitants that was found in the year 1753." The record was
          discovered in 1839 in the National Library of Brazil by Manuel
          Ferreira Lagos.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, the manuscript contains twelve pages written by an unknown
          author and seems to be part of a letter. The tale within the pages
          follows a group of "Bandeirantes," another name for slavers/explorers
          in Brazil, and their discovery of an abandoned city in the state of
          Bahia. The short version goes as follows.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As they journeyed through the rugged terrain, a contingent led by a
          Portuguese colonel chanced upon a breathtaking sight: a deserted
          settlement perched atop a high mountain range. The entrance to this
          mysterious city was adorned with a Roman-looking triple archway and
          etched with cryptic inscriptions in an unknown language, shrouding the
          place in an aura of enigma. As they ventured further into the city,
          they came upon a square dominated by a black pedestal bearing a statue
          of a man pointing resolutely northwards. An expansive building,
          resplendent with intricate reliefs and inlaid works depicting crosses,
          crows, and other intricate designs, loomed nearby. The magnificent
          street portico was graced by a relief carving of a half-naked figure
          sporting a laurel crown, imbuing the place with an air of regal
          majesty.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Undaunted, the group explored the abandoned mineshafts and were
          astounded to discover rocks infused with silver and inscriptions that
          defied their attempts at decipherment. Their discovery of a sprawling
          countryside manor was even more astonishing, replete with untold
          secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. In their quest for
          riches, they tested the soil near the nearby river and were rewarded
          with a bounty of gold flecks. Despite the allure of wealth, the author
          pauses to reflect on the deserted city's strange and curious state and
          marvels at the fauna that now inhabits the ruins. As the group
          searched the town, one expedition member found a remarkable treasure -
          a gold coin portraying a young boy kneeling on one side and a bow,
          arrow, and crown on the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we delve deeper into the annals of history, we often find that the
          intersection of nationalism and "alternative history" is a theme that
          rears its head time and time again. And so it was when the Brazilian
          Historic and Geographic Institute received the details of the
          enigmatic Manuscript 512.
        </p>
        <p>
          With hopes of uncovering evidence of a Greco-Roman culture to bolster
          their newly-formed Brazilian identity, expeditions were launched in
          search of the lost city the manuscript purportedly detailed. Alas, all
          efforts were in vain. But the document's legacy would prove to be
          far-reaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manuscript 512 became a source of inspiration for many in the arts and
          literature. Perhaps most famously, it was the foundation for Sir
          Arthur Conan Doyle's novel "The Lost World," published in 1912. And it
          was also entwined in the lore of Percy Fawcett's search for the lost
          city of Z.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doyle also appears in some of the more elaborate versions of the
          Middleton story. Or rather, Doyle's assistant is claimed to have kept
          a cache of documents safe about Alfred Middleton. The age of the
          assistant is a bit vague, but some articles of a bit dubious origin
          claim that this assistant should have sent or received an email about
          this. A claim that would be impressive since Doyle's assistant, Alfred
          H. Wood, died in 1941.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the realm of alternative history, tall tales, and half-truths often
          capture the public's imagination. One such account involves the
          supposed cache of documents kept by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's
          assistant, which is always unnamed within the accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are many holes in this narrative. Some articles with
          dubious origins claim that this assistant either sent or received an
          email about these documents to or from the British consulate. But
          considering that we know that Doyle's assistant was Alfred H. Wood,
          who died in 1941, the likelihood of such an email is slim to none.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all of this leads us to Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Fawcett. A
          fascinating person who might be the main inspiration for the Indiana
          Jones character. Fawcett also became friends with Arthur
          Conan Doyle, who based some of his books on Fawcett.

        <p>
          Percy Fawcett was a man cut from a different cloth. After retiring
          from the military in 1906, he became obsessed with exploring the
          uncharted wilderness of Brazil. In a time when being an adventurer was
          an actual job title, Fawcett mounted seven expeditions between 1906
          and 1924, earning a reputation as a capable explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fawcett had a different approach toward the indigenous people of the
          Amazon than others. He treated the locals respectfully and patiently,
          offering gifts on contact to be better accepted. This set him somewhat
          apart from other explorers in the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even a man like Fawcett couldn't escape the pull of war. When
          World War I broke out, he reenlisted at the age of 50, leaving his
          explorations behind and heading back to Britain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1925, Fawcett embarked on his final expedition to find the City of
          Z, accompanied by his son Jack and Jack's friend, Raleigh Rimmel. They
          were last seen on May 29, 1925, entering the jungle in search of the
          lost city. Despite numerous search and rescue missions, no trace of
          Fawcett or his team was ever found, and their disappearance remains a
          mystery. The last known location of the party was at the Horse Shoe
          Camp, where Fawcett wrote one of his last known letters.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The theories around Fawcett's disappearance range from dying from
          starvation, exhaustion, and being killed by one of the tribes in the
          area to being sucked into a time warp or kidnapped by aliens. In the
          most likely hood, they got hit by disease or had an accident that
          killed them. But in 1979, Fawcett's signet ring turned up in a
          pawnshop within the small city of Cuiab&aacute;. Located in the
          southwest of Brazil. This, of course, led to speculations that bandits
          were behind his disappearance. Until we find the expeditions bodies,
          we won't have any specific answers, but the jungles have claimed
          people in the past and will continue to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at pictures of Percy Fawcett, we're met by a grave man with a
          steely gaze. He could almost be likened to a mysterious wilderness
          guide, living off the land and keeping to himself in a Victorian
          post-apocalyptic world. It's also abundantly clear that Fawcett is the
          inspiration for the stories when we look at the pictures accompanying
          the posts. Among the photos is a portrait of a man with a beard, a
          straight nose, and a piercing stare wearing a pith helmet. If we
          compare this face with the pictures we have of Fawcett, there is no
          doubt that this portrait is based on Fawcett's photographs.&nbsp;

          Now, I want to warn you, dear listeners, that some don't let facts get
          in the way of a good story in the world of alternative history. We've
          seen it before, and we'll see it again. Sensationalistic blogs like
          "Lost Books" and "Mysteries Unsolved" have been quick to jump on the
          Middleton bandwagon, but let's take a closer look at one of their
          supposed sources, shall we? They claim a book called "The Lost Casket
          of Dawleetoo" supposedly contains the story of Middleton, gold
          statues, and the lost city. They even named the author, a Frenchman
          named Fortun&eacute; du Boisgobey.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the thing, folks. While Fortun&eacute; du Boisgobey was a
          real author, he never wrote about Dawleetoo or Alfred Isaac Middleton.
          In 1881 du Boisgobey published a book called La Main coup&eacute;e; in
          its English translation, it is called "The lost casket." This book is
          available on the Internet Archive and Gutenburg Project for free, but
          I must warn you. It is not as exciting as these alternative history
          blogs make it out to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, with all of this knowledge, we could be pretty confident when
          declaring the story and the pictures a hoax. But all this research
          might have been a bit overkill. Since we do know who did create both
          the account and the photos. On July 29, 2022, Visual Effects
          Supervisor Mitch Gates posted on his Facebook wall. The post got
          little traction compared to later reposts, but it is the origin of the
          whole concept. The post even contained the hashtag #midjourney.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mich Gates has created quite a lot of these AI-generated pictures. One
          set depicts what we are supposed to think is the set for the faked
          moon landing conspiracy theory. While another explores a hypothetical
          future where artificial intelligence has replaced human creativity,
          leading to the downfall of art stores and the displacement of creative
          professionals. These thought-provoking images offer a unique
          perspective on the impact of technological advancements on society and
          the arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 3, 2022, Mich Gates even complained about "another share who
          forgot to credit." So it seems clear that we have the story's origin
          right here with Mich. From what I can tell, it was never intended to
          fool somebody or deceive. It was a fun thought experiment visualized
          by Midjourney with some tongue-in-cheek text added to give the
          pictures an additional flavor.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look closer at the photographs made by Gates, you will notice a
          lot of AI artifacts since these seem to not have been edited
          afterward. AI, at this point, also struggled with portraying humans,
          so all portraits look odd to the human eye. As the technology advance,
          this might not be the case in the future, and something you will need
          to keep an eye on. While we have struggled with Photoshop for some
          time, AI art has the potential for even more hoaxes. Gone are the days
          when a picture could be accepted as is. The gen five of Midjourney can
          create photo-realistic renderings of prompts you feed them on a level
          where it's tough to tell it apart from reality.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you don't trust the source, you should definitely not trust any
          pictures from there. Even if it's a trusted source, you must do some
          investigations before accepting it since they could have been duped.
          While being a skeptic has become even more challenging, we should take
          pride that it's never been more critical.
        </p>

          This would have been where I told you, listener, that all of this was
          written by an AI, like Eli Bosnicks Citation Needed episode on
          ChatGTP. And I did try to use ChatGTP to write this but first.
          Fortunately, or unfortunately, Gates created the Middleton story too
          recently, so it's not part of what ChatGTP knows. So I tried giving it
          the information I wanted to use, but the issue was that the AI started
          to make things up anyway to a point where it's started to create even
          more sources for Alfred Isaac Middleton that don't exist. When I
          called the bot out on it, I only got excuses and that it would try to
          do better in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI tools are great if you really know the material you work with
          and looking to improve your texts. But as a research assistant or a
          replacement for searching Google? Then it can be outright dangerous.
          While we have added the word intelligence to this type of bot, we must
          remember that it does not really understand things and can't separate
          between good and bad information.
        </p>

          That was all we had this time around. Due to a vacation, the next
          episode won't release until the end of May. So I will have time to
          breathe and collect myself before getting things back out there. There
          are a lot of episodes you can listen to in the meantime, and make sure
          to check out my YouTube channel. Before you know it, we will be back
          with more silly aliens and history. But till then, remember to leave a
          positive review anywhere you can, such as iTunes, Spotify, or to your
          friend at the trench. I would also recommend visiting

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.
