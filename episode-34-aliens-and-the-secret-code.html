        <p>
          The segment on Thor Heyerdahl was edited 15/4 to add clarity.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you ready to uncover the secret code to Alien navigation? Or are
          the evidence just historical sites that are being misinterpreted?
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between on the TV show Ancient Aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time we're investigating the claim that different lines and grids
          cross the earth with strange powers. According to the believers, these
          grids were used by the Ancient Aliens to navigate, and in some of the
          locations, power stations were built. So, is there any truth in this?
          Let's examine this with a bit of skepticism and science.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, we start by trying to locate what some call the World Grid,
          Planetary Grid, or Earth Energy Grid. Some propose that Plato first
          discovered this. Is this true, or was the philosopher talking about
          something else?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we go to Ireland and the Newgrange Mound. Could this monument
          hold alien alignments that the Neolithic people of Ireland could not
          have known?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we investigate Ley Lines, Viking forts, and if the Vikings could
          have traveled not by sea. But by air.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we will look into Thor Heyerdahl and ask ourselves what harm
          pseudoscience can cause and what other ideas it can inspire.&nbsp;

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 34, and we are back with
          our aliens after a more extended excursion with Graham Hancock. This
          time we will investigate how the aliens could have oriented themselves
          on earth while visiting and if there are any remains of this left. We
          will cover the supposed world grid. Could Plato have discovered these
          alien travel patterns in his day?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, we travel north and look at strange Viking forts. Were
          these alien fueling stations, or what do we know about the old Viking
          ringforts? What was their function, and in what sort of time were they
          built?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we return to Rapa Nui and look into some strange claims about
          white and bearded seafarers going from Cusco in Peru to Easter
          Island.&nbsp;
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3 id="worldgrid">World Grid</h3>
        <p>
          Our path to decoding the secret alien code starts with a grid. The
          World Grid, Planetary Grid, Earth Energy Grid, or simply Earth Grid is
          an idea that a grid spans the Earth. As we will learn, this grid does
          not have a set of easily defined properties. The World Grid is a
          concept thought up by William Becker and Bethe Hagens in 1978 (Newman,
          2008), arguing that the Earth can be sectioned into a dodecahedron
          (Becker and Hagens, 1987). Or, as Bethe Hagens describes it in more
          detail:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here you can see a cluster of ten of the triangles of the 120 that
          Plato mentioned. Besides seeing this as triangles, you can see it as
          15 equators that actually cut the Earth in half. You can see they all
          go around whichever way you look. They're all great circles. It's a
          geometric model of the Earth Energy Grid of what Plato discovered
          2,500 years ago." - Bethe Hagen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is that this grid spans our globe and ties ancient sites,
          mysterious places, and other locations together. According to Becker
          and Hagens (1987), we find increased UFO activity and megalithic
          structures. As you might presume, a part of this idea is inspired by
          Plato, who was among the first to suggest that Earth was not flat. Or
          it's more Platos student Aristoteles who presents the concept of an
          actual spherical earth (Kragh, 2007). Hold on, don't write that angry
          comment just yet. I know that Hesiod, Anaximander, and Pythagoras are
          credited with suggesting a spherical earth. Critics have pointed out
          that Hesiod was too early for this claim, but if we find first-hand
          sources, we might need to revisit this. Anaximander thought Earth
          looked like a column drum, and Pythagoras is basically attributed to
          everything in ancient Greece (Couprie, 2011). Pre-Plato, many
          philosophers argued for a flat Earth (Couprie, 2018), while the shape
          could differ philosophers like Thales, Xenophanes, and Anaxagoras
          argued that Earth was flat (Couprie, 2011). Something that aligned
          with the religious ideas of the time, where gods represented the
          Earth, sky, and stars, and where there was a real fear of the sky
          literally falling down (Kragh, 2007).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Becker and Hagens base the grid idea on something Plato (2010) wrote
          in Phaedo, in verse 110b. "It is said first that the Earth itself, if
        </p>
        <p>
          one could view it from above, would appear to the eye like one of
          those
        </p>
        <p>balls of twelve leather pieces /.../."</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;If you play Barbarian in Dungeons and Dragons, you're most
          familiar with this shape since you find it in the D12 dice. Or, if you
          want to use the fancier word for it, the dodecahedron. But note that
          Plato does not mention the shape, and just alludes to it since a ball
          with twelve pieces has a limited combination set and still be a ball.
          Plato somewhat continues describing the structure of the Earth in
          Timaeus, a text maybe more known for its Atlantis connection (see
          episode 30). But while he spends a lot of time going into the details
          of the building elements fire, air, water, and earth, he does not give
          the shape of our planet. There is this fifth element within the text,
          but in Timaeus (55c), it refers to the universe itself. The
          dodecahedron shape in the text is decorated with an animal pattern,
          alluding to the constellations. An idea that Plato probably borrowed
          from the Pythagoreans (Couprie, 2011). But where did Becker and Hagen
          get the 120 number from?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a mystery to me since, looking at Phaedo and Timaeus, we don't
          get a whole lot about the earth's shape in that sense. The closest I
          can find is the Platonic objects. Plato thought the four elements had
          different forms: fire is a tetrahedron, air is an octahedron, water is
          an icosahedron, and earth is a cube. The text also argues that all
          elements have smaller building blocks (Burgin, 2017). Each element is
          formed by smaller triangles; in this case, fire consists of 24
          triangles. But water, an icosahedron, consists of 120 triangles. Or
          rather, Plato's idea of a water molecule consists of 120 atoms
          (Burgin, 2017). Again we have an idea that crumbles if you actually
          read what the source material says.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this hypothesis also comes with even stranger claims; for
          example, Hugh Newman, in this episode, talks about the power centers
          that exist within the world grid.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's fascinating ideas that they were actually using this for
          anti-gravitational purposes. And they were actually able to lift, and
          quarry, and move the huge megalithic blocks great distances around the
          planet. And so we have to question, was there something to do with
          this grid that they were actually harnessing, and they were able to
          use the energies from it to move and construct these sites?" - Hugh
          Newman.
        </p>
        <p>
          These power centers exist within the World Grid system in locations
          such as Stonehenge, the Giza Pyramids, and Coral Castle. The issue
          with claims like this is that we can test if something strange is
          happening there. As far as I can find, gravity works as expected at
          Stonehenge and Giza Pyramids. We also have a reasonably good
          understanding of how Edward Leedskalnin built the site with simple
          block and tackle (Dunning, 2009). Some even claim (Newman, 2008) that
          the supposed Philadelphia Experiment used the grid lines to teleport
          USS Eldrige between Norfolk and Philadelphia. One of the more
          significant issues for the Philadelphia experiment is that it never
          was in Philadelphia, according to Naval History and Heritage Command
          (2017). USS Edlrige was stationed in New York when the experiment was
          supposed to have occurred in 1943. We know the exact movement of the
          ship during this time, and it's almost impossible it would have been
          in Philadelphia. Of course, the believers think the evidence from the
          Navy is just part of the conspiracy. In a conspiratorial mind, the
          proof against something becomes evidence for the conspiracy
          itself.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also claims from David Childress and others that the grid is
          used to wireless charge the alien space crafts. But again, energy can
          be measured and quantified; one that comes to mind is Earth's magnetic
          field. But I can't find any model or explanation (Campbell, 2003)
          close to what the World Grid proponents and Ancient Alien believers
          suggested. While several forces operate on earth, none shape up as
          neat grids. The ancient sites they claim incorporate the grid are
          cherry-picked, and the ones they think fit within the model are kept,
          while the misses are forgotten. This is nothing more than selective
          thinking. This a common trope among the more fringe theorists and
          something essential to look out for. William Becker, Bethe Hagens, and
          other authors like Bruce Cathie and Hugh Newman use this to defend
          their grid theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's leave this web of logical fallacies and move to a place
          where the grass is green, and the beer is dark.
        </p>
        <h3 id="newgrange">Stellar Alignments in Newgrange</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to Ireland. Home of leprechauns, Guinness, and whiskey. But
          we're not here for that. No, we're here since there are hints of star
          alignments that might suggest an extraterrestrial connection. One of
          these monuments can be found in an area the locals call Br&uacute; na
          B&oacute;inne. Located some 40 km from Dublin (or 25 miles) and
          contain a minimum of 37 passage tombs (Hensey, 2015) from the Irish
          Neolithic era. Within Br&uacute; na B&oacute;inne, we have three large
          sites of these monuments, Dowth, Knowth, and Newgrange.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In Newgrange, the Ancient Alien proponents claim that we find this
          alien star alignment. While there are more tombs in the area, the
          focus is on the large chamber tomb that is beautifully decorated. This
          pattern type is usually called megalithic art and consists of
          lozenges, curls, and circles found here and in Gavarinis, France
          (Scarre, 2009). Something worth noting is that not all of these
          patterns are in visible places; some are hidden from view (Hensey,
          2015). The reason for this is unknown. It can be argued it was
          ritualistic, a message to the gods. Some would say that it can be due
          to a change in the building plan or the reusing of stones from another
          monument (Hensey, 2015). The last statement might be the most
          plausible. We know the area has been used since Mesolithic times, and
          in the western region, there's evidence of an earlier turf mound
          (Lynch et al., 2014). The turf mound seems to have been created around
          3200 BCE, while the construction of the main Cairn started around 3000
          BCE (Lynch et al., 2014).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what about that alignment? Well, it is in two parts. The first is
          a Winter Solstice alignment that can be found in the Newgrange tomb.
          During about five days during the winter solstice, a "pencil of light"
          is visible in the rear chamber of the grave (Hensey, 2015). This is
          possible due to what's referred to as the "roof-box," the sunlight
          does not enter the grave through the entrance, but a kind of dormer.
          But this is sunken in; Hensey (2021) thinks a better description might
          be a funnel. One issue is that we are unsure if this roof-box is an
          accurate reconstruction. When O'Kelly started to excavate the
          Newgrange site in 1962, it had fallen in quite some disrepair. But it
          was not the first time the passage tomb was excavated or opened. The
          earliest documented opening is by Edward Lhwyd. It took place around
          1699 CE; later excavations would follow in 1746; disturbances around
          the entrance were reported in 1776, and it seems to have been opened
          again in early 1800 (Henesey, 2021). William Wilde mentioned the
          roof-box in 1849, but then it's theorized to have been an entrance to
          a second chamber.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So when O'Kelly started the reconstruction, he did not only have to
          deal with years of roots from trees moving things around, but he also
          had all of these past excavations to deal with. Something worth noting
          is that before O'Kellys reconstruction, the roof box was not in a
          position that allowed light to enter the chamber. But by moving the
          stones RS1 and RS2 in the base of the roof-box, the room would now see
          the sun during the solstice (Henesey, 2021). Other passage tombs from
          this era have solstice alignments, but the alignments vary between
          locations (Henesey, 2015). But we should consider if O'Kelly had
          restored this lintel differently, would this have changed how this
          phenomenon took place? Was O'Kelly repairing the mound trying to find
          an astronomical connection, or was it a coincidence? It would be
          strange if the roof-box did not have some astronomical function
          (Henesey, 2021), but we should remember that what we see today is not
          what they saw all those thousands of years ago.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So we can agree with the Ancient Alien crowd that solar alignments
          might have been significant for the Neolithic people. They do not add
          much meaning to the solstice alignment, but we're then taken for a
          ride.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "The passage and chamber are cruciform in shape. They're shaped like a
          cross, which we think is very significant because it seems to be based
          on the shape of the constellation, Cygnus, which is the swan
          constellation of the sky." - Anthony Murphy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anthony Murphy is correct in that the tomb is shaped like a cross, but
          the comparison between the Swan constellation and the Newgrange is
          far-fetched. I guess you can make it work if you remove parts of the
          constellation, but then it's not the Cygnus constellation longer. Even
          if we only focused on the crucifix form, it does not match. The tomb
          has one short chamber going northeast and an even shorter room going
          southwest. Trying to pair the mound with Cygnus is wishful thinking
          and on the verge of pareidolia. But there is an actual alignment that
          the Ancient Alien authors have missed; most of these tombs are all
          skewed right (Henesey, 2015). There's no excellent explanation for why
          this is, but it's not only that the burials are skewed. We also find
          more art and objects on the right side of the tomb (Henesey,
          2015).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Also worth noting is that while most would accept a solar solstice
          connection, there's no evidence of a stellar link at Newgrange or any
          other passage tomb. This is just wishful thinking from the proponents
          of these fringe ideas. This is not new, we have covered the "Orion
          Correlation Theory" in the past, which is usually described like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I discovered in the early 80s, that there was a correlation between
          Orion's Belt and the layout of the three pyramids, you have two large
          pyramids, aligned with each other, and the third smaller one offset
          from that alignment. Well that's the same way you have the stars. You
          have two bright stars and a third less bright star offset from the
          line of the other two. The correlation is evident." - Robert Bauval.
        </p>
        <p>
          This theory is predominantly argued by Robert Bauval and Graham
          Hancock. They have, in turn, based most of their thought on Robert
          Temple's ideas in "The Sirius Mystery" and removed the aliens to look
          more studious. But as you might suspect, there's an issue. The
          Pyramids of Giza do not align with Orion's belt without flipping the
          pyramids or the constellation upside down. Something Bauval leaves out
          here is that while the stars and pyramids might not be a perfect match
          today, they were back in 10 500 BCE. The magical date for Hancock.
          There's one hitch. The pyramid is offset 38&deg;, but if it's based on
          Orion's belt 10 500 BCE, it should be 50&deg; offset (Fairall, 2001).
          Not really a perfect match when we look closer, right.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also use different locations as evidence for this theory, such as
          Teotihuac&aacute;n, Hopi Villages in the USA, and the Thornborough
          Henges in England. All of these sites suffer from the same issue on
          closer examination. They do not line up with the Orion belt other than
          in an "if you squint your eyes" kind of way. It is a fun idea, but
          it's not really credible. You can also find a lot of things that kind
          of looks like other things by random chance. I've three birthmarks
          that kind of look like Orion's belt. Does this mean I have more of the
          Alien DNA and can do Jedi tricks?
        </p>
        <p>
          On that note, let's take a quick break while I go out to see if I can
          levitate large boulders with my mind. But when we're back, we will
          investigate ancient flight paths.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="leylines">Ley Lines</h3>
        <p>
          Let's go back in time, 1921, to be precise. A man named Alfred Watkins
          is visiting Blackwardine in England on a beautiful, if England has
          such a thing, summer day. On June 30, Alfred was pondering what sites
          to see, and while pouring over a map, he noticed something. A straight
          line could be drawn from Croft Ambury, over hill points, through
          Blackwardine, over Risbury Camp, ending at the high ground over at
          Stretton Garrison, a location Watkins assumed to be on top of an old
          Roman garrison (Watkins, 1922). When looking closer at the map,
          Watkins noted more locations within a straight line.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could not simply be chance, according to Watkins. Alfred explains
          the origin of these lines as follows.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "Presume a primitive people, with few or no enclosures, wanting a few
          necessities (as salt, flint flakes, and, later on, metals) only to be
          had from a distance. The shortest way to such a distant point was a
          straight line, the human way of attaining a straight line is by
          sighting, and accordingly all these early trackways were straight."
          Alfred Watkins (1922).
        </p>
        <p>
          Watkins postulated that these ancient people took their sightlines
          from peaks, of course not higher than 300 meters or 1000 feet
          (Watkins, 1922). But getting your lay of the land, so to say, is one
          thing, but how did they keep their direction while off the peak? To
          maintain these straight trade routes, Walkins (1922; 1945) claimed
          that they built mounds, circular earthworks, and other artificial
          markings. These mounds and monolithic monuments were later repurposed
          into burials or cult sites, but their original function was a
          waymarker. But they could also plant clusters of trees or use natural
          formations such as water and stones to mark out the route for the
          wanderers (Walkins, 1945).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Watkins was not the only one having these ideas. As Keith
          Fitzpatrick-Mattews pointed out (2014), an article was published on a
          similar theme 30 years prior. Titled "Ancient Trackways in England,"
          this paper was published in "The Antiquary - Volume XIX" in 1889 and
          written by an architect named Joseph Houghton Spencer. Our architect
          friend had a similar thought to Watkins, and Houghton started his
          paper with an anecdotal account of how he saw in Barton Grange a
          "broad pathway, about 600 feet, which is crossed by another of the
          same length, thus forming a greek cross." Spencer suggests that there
          are straight lines connecting locations in the landscape and that
          there are astronomical connections. But what Spencer failed to
          research was that what he was looking at, most likely, was the old
          remains of the Barton Grange old gardens (Fitzpatrick-Mattews, 2014).
          Looking back at maps from Barton Court, we see these features being a
          part of the garden area.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While both Watkins and Spencer had a similar idea, Watkins is the
          origin of Ley Lines as they are presented today. Watkins most likely
          didn't know about Spencer's article published 30 earlier
          (Fitzpatrick-Mattews, 2014). But that's the thing, the ideas are not
          so strange. The human mind is excellent at finding patterns, and it
          seems almost hardwired in our brains. This is how we interpret a
          shadow from a lamp to be a person or how we see shapes in clouds.
          Random noise can turn into sounds we understand or see writing in
          random places. So what Watkins and Spencer do here is commit a Type-1
          error; they have a false positive and believe something to be true
          when it's not.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Today we can be reasonably sure that these ley lines are nothing more
          than coincidence. We know these sites were constructed at widely
          different times and had diverse purposes. The archaeological dating
          has become so good that Watkin's idea of Neolithic straight trade
          routes is impossible. These Ley Lines are also selected with a bias.
          Locations from different times and eras that fit the line are
          included, while other sites that do not are left out. So while the
          science maybe isn't great here, I want to highlight that neither
          Watkins nor Spencer seemed to have any claims about either spirits,
          energy forces, or UFOs. These are things that got introduced later
          when the Ley Line idea got adopted by New Agers.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We briefly looked at Ley Lines in episode 13, when Giorgio Tsoukalos
          claimed there is a line between Calais, France, and Cales, Italy. Even
          when he made up locations that do not exist in France, he could not
          get the Ley Line straight. Unfortunately, we will witness that the
          Ancient Alien crowd has yet to learn their lesson. Because Giorgio
          describes the Ley Lines as:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Something extraordinary happened along those Ley Lines because the
          once very physical and real visit of extraterrestrial beings has been
          forgotten." - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the idea is that the Ley Lines was a navigation system for the
          aliens who visited earth. My best guess is that they left some of the
          unquantifiable energies the New Age believers talk about on the sites.
          Let's for a moment set aside the fact that believers can only measure
          these energies and that the locations they include range from
          Neolithic to overgrown gardens from the 1800s. What is the best
          evidence for these lines? Choklingly we find it in Denmark, consisting
          of several round Viking fortifications. These forts are known today as
          Trelleborgar.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="trelleborg">Viking ring fortress (Trelleborgar)</h3>
        <p>
          Let's start with some of the histories of these fortifications before
          we get into the Ancient Alien claims. Something worth noting is that
          fortifications have been part of history for a long time. The earliest
          examples of fortifications can be found in Denmark and southern Sweden
          (in Sk&aring;ne/Scania) and can be dated to Neolithic times
          (Burenhult, 2012). In Sweden, there are 1000 defense systems, most of
          which can be found in M&auml;laren Valley. Most of the intense
          construction period was during the migration period (300 CE to 800 CE)
          and consisted of highland forts and lowland forts (Burenhult, 2012).
          The largest of these fortifications is Torsburgen on Gotland, the wall
          stretching almost 2 kilometers (Burenhult, 2012).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Scandinavian fortification building continued during the Viking Era at
          settlements such as V&auml;stergarn on Gotland, Birka in Stockholm,
          and Hedeby in Denmark. What makes Trelleborgarna different is their
          design and the period when they were built. They are all circular,
          have four ports aligned with the cardinal directions, and were created
          within a short time span. The gates corresponding with the cardinal
          points seem to be inspired by Flemish fortresses constructed earlier
          (Rosendal, 2008). Round fortifications are not new. One example would
          be Ekeborg on &Ouml;land (Burenhult, 2012). But these are perfectly
          round with a very identifiable layout (Rosedal, 2008).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The currently accepted Trelleborgar is Trelleborg on Sj&aelig;lland
          (Zeeland), Nonnebakken, Fyrkat, and Aggersborg (Rosendal, 2008;
          Weidhagen-Hallerdt, 2009; Pedersen, 2016). We recently added another
          location, Borgring, also located in Sj&aelig;lland (Pedersen, 2016),
          to this group. Then we have the question that might upset any Danish
          listener: Is Trelleborgar in Sweden? Here is an excellent example of
          regional identity influencing archaeology (Pettersson, 2008); there
          are three suggested locations in Sk&aring;ne (Scania). Borgaby, which
          is more or less accepted as a Trelleborg (Rosendal, 2008;
          Weidhagen-Hallerdt, 2009; Pedersen, 2016), Helsingborg
          (Weidhagen-Hallerdt, 2009), and then we have Trelleborg. It's mainly
          the last example in the Swedish city of Trelleborg, where Danish
          archaeologists are most skeptical about the definition. For a long
          time, some protests have been against classifying the ring
          fortification in Trelleborg as what the city name seems to indicate it
          is (Petterson, 2008).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When were these Ringforts built, then? Here it becomes really
          fascinating; they are all constructed around 980 CE (Rosendal, 2008).
          Dendrochronological tests in Trelleborg on Sj&aelig;lland (Zeeland)
          show that the construction started in the winter of 980/981 CE, and
          the logs of Fyrkat started to be cut down in 979 CE (Pedersen, 2016).
          Aggersborg was built maybe earlier; we see indications that a possible
          start date would be around 970 CE. But this put the creation of the
          fortifications firmly within the reign of Harald Bl&aring;tand (Or
          Harald Bluetooth), the one who that technology you might use to listen
          to this is named after.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          These ringforts all have identical layouts, or they almost have a
          similar layout. While Trelleborg and Fyrkat are split into four equal
          quadrants consisting of 16 long houses, Aggersborg consists of 12
          quadrants and 48 longhouses. They are also strategically placed along
          important trade routes, except Aggersborg, none of them is built on
          previous settlements (Rosenberg, 1977; Pedersen, 2016). While not
          placed directly by the water, except for again Aggersborg, they are
          relatively close by when accounting for the land rise. But their
          function was to keep peace within Denmark and not to protect against
          raiders, so having them closer inland makes sense (Pedersen, 2016).
          Harald Bl&aring;tands reign was lined with internal struggle, and it
          seems that Harald ordered these to be constructed to keep the peace.
          Their intended purpose appears to not have been working very well, and
          just a few decades later, the fortifications were abandoned.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Armed with some knowledge about these fortifications, let's see what
          mainstream science is trying to hide from you. The alien proponents
          are, as usual, claiming that scientists are baffled. If we should
          believe these fringe theorists, we seem to spend our days befuddled
          about everything. Except we have spent much time studying Viking-era
          navigations and the tools they used (Bern&aacute;th et al., 2013;
          Sz&aacute;z et al., 2017). A simple yet foolproof trick taught in
          survival situations is different variations of a "sun-stick." The more
          accurate version takes about a day but results in exact directions
          (Wiseman, 2014). Alien proponents think this is a bit farfetched and
          suggest an alternative explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Given that the Vikings were basically seafaring people and these
          sites were spread out so far over land in great distances, it implies
          that maybe they had some other way of getting to these places. Perhaps
          they even were able to fly, now how they would fly, what the
          technology was &ndash; it's a good question, but it seems unlikely
          they would be able to find all these spots, surveyed and place
          monuments and structures there if they were simply a seafaring race."
          - Michel Bara.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michel Bara and others point out that the fortresses Aggersborg,
          Fyrkat, Eskeholm, and Trelleborg are in a straight line. Looking at a
          map, they appear linear, but if we draw a lone from Aggersborg and
          Trelleborg, it will miss Fyrkat with about 1,5 kilometers. Isn't it
          strange that these surveying aliens would be so much out of the
          course? Also, did you react to the new name that suddenly appeared?
          The alien proponents do claim that there's a fort on Eskeholm, a small
          Danish island. Except there isn't any archaeological site there. They
          either somehow misinterpreted located Nonnebakken further west or
          decided to move Nonnebakken to fit within their Ley Line. Things do
          not get better when they try to connect these sites with other sites
          further south.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How could a straight line link ancient Egypt, the pyramids, the
          Oracle of Delphi in Greece, and Viking fortresses that would've been
          established thousands of years later. It made no sense. But it does
          make sense if these installations are along straight lines across the
          Earth's grid, and somehow those straight lines mark navigational
          routes for ancient extraterrestrials that used them as markers to
          navigate the globe from society to society." - Bill Barnes.
        </p>
        <p>
          One important rule with Ley Lines is that distance is not your friend.
          Can we get a line to go through these locations? The answer is, sadly,
          no. If we start in Aggersborg aiming for the Giza plateau, we will
          miss Fyrkat with 1,3 kilometers, Trelleborg with 11 kilometers, and
          Deliphi with 306 kilometers. The Ley Lines seem rather useless for
          navigation. The idea proposed by the Alien Theorists is that these
          lines are flight paths, except that planes fly in an arc (Morris,
          2022), and it would be uncontroversial to assume aliens have a similar
          flying technique.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, why would aliens want to connect these forts used for such a
          short time with sites not in use by then? We know too much about these
          fortifications to attribute them to anyone other than the Danish
          Vikings. And they clearly didn't need aliens to construct them since
          they aimed to keep local rebellious people under control. The Ley Line
          theory isn't more than seeing patterns where there aren't any.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Since I've done a whole segment about Denmark without making any snide
          remarks, I deserve a break and a treat. While I'll get myself a
          standard Danish breakfast, which is a six-pack of beer and sausages,
          we will have relocated to the Pacific Ocean.

        <h3 id="heyerdahl">Thor Heyerdahl</h3>
        <p>
          This next part of the Ancient Alien episode is supposed to be about
          Geodesic placements. Looking closely at this section, you realize they
          basically repeat the claims about the World Grid but add
          misinterpreted myths. We have looked into most of those in the past,
          but Giorgio Tsoukalos did bring up a claim that got me thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since we covered the Danes without incident, how about we go after one
          of Norway's national heroes? You might even be familiar with this
          name, Thor Heyerdahl. Let's hear the claim from Ancient Aliens and see
          how it connects with Thor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The walls at Cusco are identical to the walls we can find in the base
          foundations of some of the Moais on Easter Island. And those two
          places are so far apart. I wonder how was it done? Either the builders
          traveled from one place to the other or the builders in each culture
          were visited by the same teachers. The teachers from the stars,
          extraterrestrials." - Giorgio A. Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I get bombarded with emails from Norwegians, I will not claim
          that Heyerdahl was an alien proponent. Wait until the end of this
          segment before writing that comment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We will circle back to the stone masonry claim later. But if you are
          not familiar with Heyerdahl is usually described as an adventurer with
          a background in zoology and geography. He was born in 1914 in southern
          Norway and became famous for his voyage on the raft named "Kon-Tiki"
          in 1947 over the Pacific Ocean. The reason for this journey was that
          Heyerdahl wanted to prove his theory of migration from South America;
          more on that later.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The migration into Polynesia predominantly comes from South East Asia
          and Melanesia (Vinton Kirch, 2017). But there's been questions if
          there might have been a South American contact. In 2020 a group of
          scientists published a paper in Nature (Ioannidis et al., 2020) in
          where DNA in Polynesian people could be tied to indigenous people in
          Colombia. The earliest estimated contact would be around 1150 on Fatu
          Hiva, and it was on that island Heyerdahl first came up with his
          hypothesis (Melander, 2019b). This contact might have been when the
          Polynesian explorers made their lengthiest explorations (Ioannidis et
          al., 2020). Like the article's authors, I want to note that this does
          not show the direction of the contact, and it's just as likely that
          Polynesian explorers reached the north of South America and brought
          people back, as the other way around. Paul Wallin from Uppsala
          University (2020) suggests the next step "would be to assess how well
          their model fits with material-culture studies, ethno-historical
          records, linguistics and evidence of plant and animal distributions."
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is undoubtedly some fascinating ongoing research; with more
          genetic studies of the populations, we will undoubtedly learn more
          about our past (Ioannidis et al., 2020). Does this mean that Heyerdahl
          was on to something? To some extent, it could be argued that Thor was
          somewhat correct, but there is more to Heyerdahl's ideas than usually
          is brought up.
        </p>
        <h3>Kon-Tiki Theory</h3>
        <p>
          A large part of Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki theory was that while migration
          occurred from South East Asia, it could not explain the monuments he
          saw. Heyerdahl suggested that there had been a migration from South
          America of white, bearded Caucasian looking people with blue eyes and
          red or blond hair (Heyerdahl, 1952; Holton, 2004; Magelssen, 2016;
          Mellander, 2019b). These culture bearers were the people who
          introduced the ideas of culture and stone cutting to Polynesia. These
          ideas are based on the Spanish chroniclers who described the Inkan god
          Viracocha as a white-bearded man (Heyerdahl, 1952; Holton, 2004;
          Magelssen, 2016; Mellander, 2019b). This description is as we noted
          with the claim that Quetzalcoatl was white, an idea presented by
          Spanish colonizers. The first claim that Quetzalcoatl was from
          Ger&oacute;nimo de Mendieta. Pedro Cieza de Le&oacute;n was the first
          who describe Viracocha as white in 1553. But no scholar has found a
          pre-colonial description of these gods that match what the Spanjards
          after contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heyerdahl took this white god idea and changed it a little. Instead of
          one person, Viracocha or Con-Tiki, was to represent one group. This
          group emigrated from the west to South America, bringing culture,
          stonework, written language, and society (Heyerdahl, 1952; Mellander,
          2019b). This theory includes that these white culture bearers made the
          monumental buildings around Titicaca (Holton, 2004). Heyerdahl claimed
          in 1979 that "/../ Incas lived more or less as savages till a
          light-skinned, bearded foreigner and his entourage came to their
          country, taught them the ways of civilization, and departed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Heyerdahl suggested these white gods possibly originated from
          Marrocco, where the Nordic people of Scandinavia might have stemmed
          from (Magelssen, 2016). That's why Heyerdahl set out on the Ra and Ra
          II expeditions with boats based on Egyptian drawings (Magelssen,
          2016).
        </p>
        <h3>Scientific Racism&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>
          We see examples other examples of scientific racism in Heyerdahl's
          writings. In "Fatu-Hiva Back to nature" from 1974, Heyerdahl describes
          an excursion to collect skulls. Before traveling to Fatu-Hiva for a
          scientific study in 1937, Thor was asked by his university and the
          chief anthropologist in Nazi Germany, Hans G&uuml;nther, to bring back
          indigenous craniums (Heyerdahl, 1974 p. 81). To save time, Heyerdahl
          and his wife decided to head for an old temple where it was rumored to
          be hundreds of skulls. After arriving at the site, they learned that
          the rumor was accurate, and Heyerdahl describes what he saw "There
          must have been more than a hundred, like a hatchery of ostrich eggs.
          Some were complete and bleached like coral by the strong sun; others
          were broken, fragmentary, and even stained green by age. I did not
          need calipers to see that most were typical long-heads, like
          Europeans, some more so than others (Heyerdahl, 1974 p. 81)." Thor
          refers to the Cephalic index, an idea introduced by the Swedish
          professor Anders Retzius and further worked on by Gustaf Ratzius. The
          idea was to prove a hierarchy among the races by measuring the
          craniums, dividing them into three distinct ground, long, medium, and
          short heads. This type of racial anthropology was common until the
          first half of the 20th century. The habit of stealing craniums was
          common; Retzius had some 800 skulls collected. Today these collections
          are slowly returning to their origins (Fugelsnes, 2022; &Aring;rhen,
          2022); the Retzius collection is going slower than the smaller
          Heyerdahl.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Heyerdahls Kon-Tiki's theory, the Polynesians were
          populated by two immigration waves. First came the white-bearded
          culture bringers and settled, then there was a second wave of a
          yellow/brown race Heyerdahl refers to as the Maori-Polynesians from
          South East Asia (Heyerdahl, 1952; Melander, 2019b). This second
          invasion was of a more violent and primitive people that overtook the
          islands by force and sometimes assimilated with the caucasian like
          original inhabitants (Heyerdahl, 1952). But Heyerdahl makes a clear
          distinction that the white culture bringers were of a higher
          civilization spreading their knowledge as they went. There's no secret
          that Heyerdahl was a strong proponent of diffusion; more correct would
          be to describe it as hyperdiffusion. Reading the books, we see a lot
          of this colonial language used to minimize indigenous people, such as
          while Europeans invent something, other cultures stumble upon a
          discovery (Spurr, 1993). Authors like Holton and Magelssen (2004;
          2016) point out that this kind of diffusion is used to this day,
          impacting legislation, and is used to deny land and other benefits to
          the indigenous populations. Peru's government even supported
          Heyerdahl's expedition since it endorsed the idea that whites owned
          the ground before the Quechua; therefore, they would not need to
          return any land (Holton, 2004). Holton points out (2004) that this
          White-Race idea has been used in Bolivia, Paraguay, and Brazil to
          exalt a preferred pre-history while being able to turn down claims
          from the indigenous people.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Reading Heyerdahl's 1952 book American Indians in the Pacific, we see
          many racial ideas. Ranging from racial hygiene to racial wars.
          Heyerdahl mentions in &ldquo;<em>American Indians in the Pacific</em
          >&rdquo; that these necessarily came from Europe (Heyerdahl, 1952, p.
          225, 304), and that the white skin and fair hair could be a local
          mutation. But it seems that Heyerdahl changed his mind somewhat when
          trying to prove the Mediterranean migration to South America with Ra
          and Ra II (Magelssen, 2016).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Im not claiming that Heyerdahl was. But the language and ideas
          presented in his book are inherently colonial and racist. These
          explanations were not uncommon for the time (Melander, 2019b), and
          some have pointed out that when Heyerdahl said
          &ldquo;primitive,&rdquo; it was not meant as inferior. This a
          statement that sounds a bit odd when we see in the books a clear order
          of where high civilization is associated with the white-bearded men,
          while the other non-white groups are viewed as violent and primitive
          (Holton, 2004; Magelssen, 2016; Mellander, 2019b). We can't also see
          these ideas in a vacuum. These books are used by different white
          supremacy organizations and authors like Arthur Kemp (Holton, 2004).
          Even if some didn't think these ideas were wrong back then, we know
          better now and must deal with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's essential also to note that Heyerdahl continued to argue for
          these hyperdiffusion ideas well after Collin Renfrew's "Before
          Civilization" and when archaeology switched to a post-processual
          approach. In the later books, we continue to see depictions of liking
          people to Neanderthals (Holton, 2004) and depict people of color as
          more primitive. Heyerdahl also never recanted or changed these ideas
          (Holton, 2004; Magelssen, 2016) and was trying to prove them until he
          died in 2002.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you go to the Kon-Tiki Museum in Oslo, you will find a museum
          focusing on Heyerdahl as an adventurer and worker for world peace.
          Racial ideas are conveniently left out (Magelssen, 2016). Josephine
          Rasmussen and Vibeke Viestad published an article in 2021 in the
          journal Critical Arts, discussing the colonial legacy of two Norwegian
          museums. In it, they point out the problematic legacy of the museum
          that The Kon-Tiki Museum had not dealt with. Ranging from the human
          remains collected by Heyerdahl to the looted artifacts he brought
          back. While it could be argued that some of these objects were
          received through trade, Rasmussen and Vistad (2021) point out the
          uneven power structures in these trades. The Kon-Tiki Museum, as
          Rasmussen and Vistad point out in a 2022 comment to the article that
          the museum has not dealt with the provenance of these items within
          their exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
          This behavior of not properly dealing with this legacy is not only
          something the Kon-Tiki Museum should be accused of. But we can compare
          this to Karolinska Institutet's openness towards its own legacy.

            >In public communication, they state</a
          >, &ldquo;<em
            >In the 19th century, the dominant colonial world order influenced
            KI's professors and researchers. Some of them committed acts or
            expressed opinions that, from our point of view today, would be
            regarded as unethical, unscientific, undemocratic or racist. Those
            things are part of KI's history.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          I bring this up because we must deal with these old ideas and
          pseudoarchaeological claims even if we don't want to. We also need to
          accept that these ideas have real-world consequences. The upside of
          Heyerdahl's thesis is that the scientific community worked hard to see
          if there was truth to these ideas. Thanks to this, we now have one of
          our history's best-understood prehistoric migration processes
          (Melander, 2019b). While the study in Nature is fascinating, it does
          not mean Heyerdahl was right, partly correct, but his white gods
          should be dismissed as the pseudo-science it is.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To tie this segment back together. Do you remember the Ahu Vinapu or
          foundation that Giorgio Tsoukalos mentioned before? That this wall was
          evidence of a connection between Cusco and Rapa Nui. Well, this is a
          Heyerdahl idea. Sure, Tsoukalos has added some aliens, but it's an
          example of how pseudo-science can influence even stranger
          claims.&nbsp;
