          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in
          popular media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 65, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This episode will be a bit different than
          normal. First, it was recorded in Rome. So, if you wonder why there's
          any difference in the audio, it might be it. Secondly, there will not
          be too many aliens. Don't worry, it will be a fun one, we will finally
          find Europe's only ancient pyramid. They were not in Bosnia or Greece
          but in Italy all along. Then we'll bust some Colosseum myths and talk
          a little about Romes's obsession with moving obelisks.
        </p>
        <p>
          As always, thank you to the Patreons and members! Your support is
          fantastic, and more bonus episodes will be released shortly. If you
          want to help and finance the show, wait until the end, and I'll tell
          you how.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="europepyramid">Europe's only ancient pyramid</h2>
        <p>
          So I have made my way all the way to Rome, where we find Europe's only
          ancient pyramid. Behind me, you can see the Pyramid of Gaius Sestius.
          As you might suspect, he was quite an important character within
          ancient Roman society. He was a praetor, a tribune of the plebs, and a
          noteworthy member of one of Rome's religious corporations. He served
          as a septimvir for the Apollonius, one of the four religious
          corporations operating in ancient Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pyramid was not built by Sestius himself but upon his order. In
          his testament, Sestius stated that he wanted this pyramid to be built
          outside of Rome and completed in 330 days. This number was significant
          to Sestius, who left this construction project to his heir, whose name
          is inscribed on the side of the pyramid.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the side of the pyramid are two original texts from its
          construction and a third text from the 1600s, added during excavations
          to determine its origins. Gaius Sestius, son of Lucius of the Polia,
          was a member of the College of Apollonius, Praetor, Tribune of the
          Plebs, and Septimvir of Apollonius. The work was completed in
          accordance with his will in 330 days by the decision of the heir
          Lucius Pontus Mela, son of Publius of the Claudia, and Pothos, a
          freedman. The mention of a freedman in the inscription indicates his
          significant role in the construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the pyramid stands in a bustling intersection with heavy
          traffic, but the area was very different when it was built. Its
          construction likely occurred between 18 BCE and 12 BCE, though the
          date is not specified on the pyramid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rome originally had two pyramids, but only this one survives. As Rome
          expanded, the pyramid became incorporated into the city walls built
          between 271 and 274 CE. This incorporation was necessary as Roman
          burial practices forbade burials within city limits. This rule needed
          adjustment as Rome grew.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pyramid of Gaius Sestius does not resemble Egyptian pyramids
          because it was influenced by Nubian pyramid styles. During Sestius'
          time, Rome had incorporated Nubia into its empire, and Nubian pyramids
          with steep angles were admired. The construction materials and methods
          of the Pyramid of Gaius Sestius also differ from Egyptian and Nubian
          pyramids, featuring smaller decorative blocks and a unique style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visitors can enter the pyramid on the second and fourth Saturday of
          each month to see frescoes and a modest burial chamber. This
          particular pyramid is distinct because it lacks a corbeled roof, which
          sets it apart from other pyramids. Additionally, it is notable for
          being relatively smaller than its counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, the Pyramid of Gaius Sestius is Europe's sole ancient
          pyramid, a testament to Roman architectural adaptation and cultural
          influence.
        </p>
        <h2 id="colossuem">Colosseum</h2>
        <p>
          The valley where the Colosseum stands today looked a lot different in
          the past. The valley would have been narrower and deeper, and before
          the construction of the theater, it was surrounded by several hills.
          We can still see some of the hills today. The Palatine, Fagutal,
          Oppinian, and Caelian can still be seen and visited. Another hill
          would have been visible too from here, the Velia; it was, however,
          leveled during the construction of the Via dell' Impero. Even if the
          area between the hills isn't optimal for human habitation, we can
          still see people living here in the seventh and sixth centuries.
          During this era, those living up on the hills seem to move down into
          the valley to gain better access to the river Tiber.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As people moved down into the valley, it also quickly became connected
          to the mythology surrounding Rome's founding. This has become more
          evident in recent excavations on the Palatine's northeast slope.
          Archaeologists have found a sizeable sacred area constructed here in
          the sixth century BCE. When we got to the late Republic and early
          Imperial era, this district was one of Rome's largest and most densely
          populated places. However, a great fire in 64 CE would put a drastic
          end to that. This fire demolished this district, and nearly half of
          Rome rose in flames. Today, we are not entirely sure what caused the
          fire. I can stress, though, that there is no need for a massive
          conspiracy. Remember that the favelas were mostly built with wood and
          constructed more or less on top of each other. In addition, open
          flames were necessary for cooking and lighting at night. Yet, many
          fingers have later in history pointed towards Nero as the cause of the
          fire.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="neros-fire">
          Nero didn't start the fire; it was always burning, as the world kept
          turning
        </h2>
        <p>
          Today, I don't think any historians believe that Nero planned these
          fires. If there are, I've not been able to find them at least. But
          let's put it like this: Nero had very little to gain and a lot to lose
          by staging the fires. While the Emperor is often described as
          unstable, he is not stupid. His enemies would have gained much
          ammunition for their propaganda if they were credible eyewitnesses.
          Even without their accusations, they still survive to our day. Nero
          also lost his precious art collection in the fire, risked losing his
          popularity among the plebs, and, in the end, used vast amounts of his
          wealth to rebuild the city.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Tacitus that would have been a contemporary with the fires gives us
          several versions of the causes. In his work, the Annals in book
          15.33-47, Tacitus covers the Great Fire of Rome and claims, "A
          disaster followed—whether accidental or treacherously contrived by the
          emperor is uncertain, as authors have given both accounts; worse,
          however, and more dreadful than any which have ever happened to this
          city by the violence of fire." Tacitus then goes on to talk about the
          events and while mentioning that Nero was not in town for the event,
          there where rumors that "at the very time when the city was in flames,
          the Emperor appeared on a private stage and sang of the destruction of
          Troy." So Tacitus seems to try to be a bit neutral, presenting
          different versions of the events and the causes.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Other authors are more direct in their blame. In 121 CE, Suetonius
          wrote in his book "Life of the Twelve Ceasars" that Nero started the
          fire because the city was too ugly. He wanted to reshape it in his
          image. We again find the singing part: "Viewing the conflagration from
          the tower of Maecenas and exulting, as he said, 'in the beauty of the
          flames', he sang the whole of the 'Sack of Ilium,' in his regular
          stage costume." Cassius Dio claims in his Roman History, book 62,
          verses 16-18, written around 221 CE, that Nero sent out men on the
          town to burn it down. The Emperor is then to have "put on the
          professional cithara players garb, and sang 'The Sack of Troy' (so he
          asserted), although to common minds, it seemed to be 'The Sack of
          Rome'." From this passage, we get the saying that "Nero fiddled while
          Rome burned," stemming from a mistranslation or an attempt to make the
          instrument more relatable in the 17th-century play The Tragedy of
          Nero. While Cassius Dio never explicitly claimed that Nero played an
          instrument, most poetry recitals during this time were accompanied by
          an instrument. While only the garb is mentioned, it's very plausible
          that Cassius meant for it to be an instrument there, too.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while Nero most likely was innocent of the fire, he seems to have
          blamed it on the tiny Jewish cult called the Christians, leading to a
          minor local persecution. Four years after the fire, Nero died in 68
          CE. Shortly after, the former Emperor was sentenced posthumous to
          "damnatio memoriae." This means all of his monuments were to be
          destroyed, even the large palace he had started building where
          Coloseum now stands. The following Emperor Vespasian from the Flavian
          family saw the need for a permanent amphitheater. With the area of
          Neros Domus Aurea opened up, he used this to his political advantage.
          He regifted the land back to the public as a place for entertainment.
          Just imagine how this must have affected Vespasian's approval rating
          among the Roman population. The construction of this enormous arena
          would take ten years and be completed by Vespasian's son Titius in 80
          CE.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="gladiatorgreeting">For those about to rock</h2>
        <p>
          Colosseum's construction took about ten years, and the quick
          construction was partly due to the reuse of material from Nero's
          constructions. It's not only in the material parts of Nero's legacy is
          preserved, but also in the name. Today, you might hear this building
          being referred to as the Flavian Amphitheater, but there's no real
          evidence this name was used in Roman times. While it's easy to think
          that the Colosseum refers to the giant theater, it's actually in
          reference to a large bronze statue outside. The statue depicted the
          god Sól, or Helios, the sun god. The statue, however, didn't start out
          like that; it started out as the Colossus of Nero. Instead of melting
          it down when "damnatio memoriae" went into effect, it was reworked
          into the image of a diety. I don't think Nero would have protested
          this, to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Titus inaugurated the arena in 80 CE with games that lasted 100
          days. These games would not have been cheap and must have been an
          unforgettable event that remained a topic of conversation for decades.
          The Flavian dynasty had procured considerable wealth from their
          successes in the Jewish wars. There would have been beast hunts,
          gladiator fights, and even naval battles, an event we will circle back
          to in a moment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to take a moment here and talk about a common misconception I
          had until quite recently. From movies, books, games, and other pop
          culture sources, we get this picture of gladiators entering the arena
          and marching up in front of the Emperor. There, they stop and utter
          these famous words: "Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant." Or, in
          English, "Hail Cecar, those who are about to die salute you." It's
          powerful imagery, and it's easy to see how people just accept it as
          true. With high certainty, though, this was not a standard gladiator
          greeting. The only time we know it was, in fact, used was in a
          naumachy, or naval battle, that took place in 52 CE on Lake Fucine,
          organized by Claudius. Three authors mention this naumachy. Tacitus
          was the first, and he doesn't mention this greeting. Later, author
          Suetonius is the first to mention it, with the addition that Claudius
          responded wittely "Aut non." Cassius Dio is the third and might be
          quoting Suetonius on this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Worth noting here that it's not gladiators that these authors are
          writing about here but condemned criminals. Suetonius and Cassius Dio
          frame this as an attempt by these men to be spared. When these pleas
          for mercy were ignored, these two authors claim that the fighters
          refused or fought in a way that would not hurt their opponents. A
          pretty different tale compared to Tacitus, who wrote, "The battle,
          though one of criminals, was contested with the spirit and courage of
          freemen; and, after much blood had flowed, the combatants were
          exempted from destruction." So, if this greeting even happened at all,
          it could be debated, but we got a pretty catchy AC/DC song out of it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="navalbattle">You sank my battleship</h2>
        <p>
          So, we have already mentioned naval battles, and a common claim about
          the Colosseum is that maritime battles were arranged at the arena.
          While sounding a bit over the top, it seems it could have happened. It
          was not a regular thing and likely only occurred twice in the arena's
          history. One time, during the inauguration of the arena, Titus did so
          in 80 CE, and the second time, in 85 CE, arranged by Domitian. This
          would also be the Emperor who would complete the arena, construct the
          lower gallery we see today at the site, and stop any future water
          events at the theater.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it must have been an experience for those attending the
          naumachy, the Colosseum isn't that big. The arena part of the
          Colosseum is only something like 80 times 47 meters. This means that
          you can't have large ships or too many vessels in there. It's also
          hard for them to move around, making the battle relatively stationary.
          Compare this to the Augustinian basin, which would allow for a proper
          naumachy.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          By building the lower galleries, you lost the water element but, in
          turn, gained the ability to make the fights and hunts more
          interactive. With these galleries, animals, sceneries, people, and
          other things could be raised from below up on the arena. Whole forests
          and beasts could suddenly appear in front of the crowd with impressive
          lifts and trapdoors.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="gladiatrix">Gladiatrix&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          Did women fight in the arena? Based on historical sources, women
          participated as fighters on occasion. An issue for us today is that
          most of these sources have a tendency to only focus on the sexiness of
          these fighting women and the novelty of the act. Kathleen Coleman has
          done some fantastic work trying to shed light on these combatants.
          From Coleman and others' work, we can see that there was a profession
          of trained female gladiators. It is harder to know if a male or female
          gladiator was in the arena because they have no separate words. Or a
          masculine or feminine version. There isn't a gladiatrix entering the
          scene. The closest word we have is a very uncommon one, Lydia. The
          word, however, seems to be used for female slaves connected to the
          gladiator schools who were the lovers of a gladiator. It seems to not
          have been used when discussing a woman fighting in the arena,
          though.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few different sources for women in the arena. One part is
          laws that forbade daughters, granddaughters, great-granddaughters, and
          wives to senators or equestrians from participating in the games. A
          law not needed if it didn't happen.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Tacitus lamented that during Nero's games in 63 CE, "prominent matrons
          and senators disgraced themselves by appearing in the amphitheater."
          Cassius Dio mentions that female and male venatores or hunters
          participated in the beast hunt during Titus opening games. Domitian is
          supposed to have liked seeing women fighting people with dwarfism in
          the arena. Statius also describes professional women gladiators in his
          work Silvae. Marcus Valerius Martialis mentions female gladiators and
          venatores in his poems.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it might have been, to some extent, a novelty act, women
          definitely engaged in combat and hunting in the public games in Rome.
        </p>
        <h2 id="obelisks">Obelisks in Rome</h2>
        <p>
          So, if you happen to visit Rome, you might notice that there are a lot
          of obelisks standing around in the city. In fact, there are more
          obelisks in Rome than in Egypt. So, eight ancient Egyptian obelisks
          here in Rome still stand. But in Egypt, there are seven obelisks still
          standing. In total, there are 13 obelisks that you can visit here in
          Rome. However, as I mentioned, eight of them are from ancient Egypt.
          The rest were later replications by the Romans, who wanted more
          obelisks and didn't want to go to Egypt to fetch more.
        </p>
        <p>
          From historical sources that we have preserved to our day, they
          shipped between 40 and 50 obelisks from ancient Egypt to Rome. So, the
          first obelisk moved by the Romans is the one you see behind us here at
          the Flaminian square, and the obelisk is called the Flaminian obelisk.
          The obelisk was moved to Rome on the order of Emperor Augustus,
          formerly known as Octavian. This large stone obelisk is made out of
          Egyptian granite and weighs 263 tons. So this was not something that
          would be able to move quite quickly. They actually had to do a couple
          of trial runs, and these trials started in 13 BCE. Augustus then
          ordered two obelisks to be moved from Heliopolis to Alexandria, and
          this took a little bit, but they figured out how to do this well. They
          then moved on in 10 BCE to move two obelisks from Heliopolis. One of
          them is the one you see behind us here, and the other obelisk is today
          found at the square of Montecitorio. Augustus ordered this movement of
          these two obelisks a bit to celebrate his victory over Cleopatra and
          Mark Anthony. But we will get to more reasons behind this move in just
          a moment. They managed to move these large stone pillars across the
          Mediterranean using technology similar to ancient Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah. According to our sources, the Romans used similar technology
          inspired by the ancient Egyptians to move the obelisk through the
          Nile. So, they designed the ships in a manner similar to the ancient
          Egyptians' stone-moving barges.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why did the Romans move so many Egyptian obelisks to Rome? To
          answer this question, we need to go to a different location to figure
          this out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here at Circus Maximus, Emperor Augustus placed one of the Egyptian
          obelisks that he brought back from Egypt. So, the obelisk would have
          stood in the center of the Spina here. And that's also why Rome
          brought in so many in the end, because later in Roman history when you
          had these arenas for horse races, you wanted one at each end of the
          spine. So, one over there and one over there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second Egyptian obelisk that Augustus brought to Rome became part
          of his giant sundial. While the Romans were excellent engineers, the
          movement of these giant obelisks was still viewed as quite an
          achievement in ancient Rome.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the ships they used to transport these giant obelisks from Egypt to
          Rome were often put out on display when the task was complete. So, the
          citizens of Rome could marvel at the large vessels used to transport
          the obelisks. And if you read Pliny the Elder, he covers these just a
          few years after the first obelisks were moved to Rome. It's not really
          strange that ancient Roman citizens looked upon these obelisk
          movements as technical achievements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest obelisks ever moved by the Romans were not the first one
          by Augustus but a later one known today as the Lateran Obelisk. Once
          upon a time, this giant stone pillar weighed a whopping 413 tons.
          Today, it weighs only 330 tons because it was toppled over in an
          earthquake, and part of the obelisk broke down and couldn't wait to be
          put back together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something worth noting is that the Romans, while being more
          technically advanced, used most of the same methods as the ancient
          Egyptians when raising and transporting these obelisks. The difference
          is that the Romans used pulleys.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing that the ancient Egyptians, during the construction of many
          of these obelisks, did not have access to other than the similarity in
          the tools and the ways they transported the obelisks. But when it came
          to putting the obelisk up on this pedestal, they used pulleys.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the ancient Egyptians', we're not a hundred percent clear on which
          method to use, which they built it up and then toppled over. If they
          build a larger hill and then just drag it up to the top and then slid
          it down on the other side, there's several different possible
          solutions to the issues that do not require a pulley system.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a pulley system isn't essential for raising an obelisk, as we
          discussed. Wally Wallington from the US has demonstrated that with
          simple fulcrums and levers and plain sticks, you can, if you have some
          time on your hands, you can get these large blocks in place by
          yourself and build. He builds his own Stonehenge in his backyard. If
          you're not familiar with this person.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while putting it on the spina in the circus racetracks was one
          reason for this obelisk to be transported to Rome, it's not the only
          explanation for them because later in Roman history, there was a bit
          of Egyptian mania, cults dedicated to Isis and the Serapis sort of
          become a bit popular. And they imported these obelisks to, you know,
          decorate these Egyptian-Roman temples dedicated to these mystery
          cults.
        </p>
        <p>
          These actually started with Augustus bringing the first two obelisks
          here to Rome. Before that, the Roman government and those in charge of
          Rome were a bit skeptical of this non-Roman religion starting to pop
          up in Rome. Augustus managed to change this with these two obelisks
          that he imported here because he did not only put them up for
          decoration, but they also have the original meaning of the obelisk.
          They were a sort of sun symbol, and I talked more about this in the
          special episode about the obelisk. But he dedicated this obelisk to
          the Roman god Sol, the sun god within the Roman Pantheon. This opened
          up the Egyptian influence to start making its way into Roman culture
          and civilization and being accepted within Roman society.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yes, this is why we have more obelisks in Rome than in ancient
          Egypt: They were well exported out of the country. And it really shows
          that if it was possible for the Romans, I don't think it was
          impossible for the ancient Egyptians either. They didn't need aliens
          to solve this type of thing, as we see later in history.
