          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between on the TV show Ancient Aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This time we&rsquo;re going to find what once was lost. We&rsquo;re
          looking into what Ancient Aliens believe to be lost worlds and trying
          to find out if that&rsquo;s the case or if there could be another
          explanation. This time we will visit the city of Cop&aacute;n located
          in Honduras, according to some theories, there&rsquo;s evidence in
          some statutes of alien visitation. We continue to Nemrud Dagi, where
          we look into astronomy and explain the origin of the three wise men of
          the New Testament. We continue to Rappa Nui where we look into the
          creation and movement of the Moai statues and a strange cult dedicated
          to the manutara. Lastly, we will see if the origin of humans might
          have been in the Persian Gulf.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With the latest research, skepticism, and critical thinking, we will
          find the true origin of our past.

          This episode is based on the claims in Ancient Aliens episode four of
          season three called "Aliens and Lost Worlds" (S03E08).

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 27, where we will explore
          the lost worlds of alien visitation. In this episode, we will explore
          Copan, Nemrud Dagi, Peru, and Rappa Nui and could we have found the
          location of the garden of Eden. Paradise on earth and the origin of
          humans according to the Abrahamic faiths.&nbsp;
        </p>

          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3>Cop&aacute;n</h3>
        <p>
          The episode starts quite decent, we have some strange wording, but I
          think we can let it slide. In this first section, we will deal with
          the site of Cop&aacute;n. A site that Mayans have occupied since the
          Preclassic period.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mayan civilization consisted of city-states with a local ruler and
          alliances. They share a common language, culture, and religion but
          still have variations and regional design and architecture. Even if we
          can see influences from mostly the larger states trickle down to other
          places.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maya history is divided into five periods, Archaic, Preclassic,
          Classic, Postclassic, and Contact. These are then divided into
          divisions within these periods. Somewhat similar to Egypt and the Old,
          Middle, and New kingdom with subsequent periods of intermediate
          periods. Showing that chronology within archeology can be quite a
          mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Maya civilization did start roughly around 2000 BCE in the
          Preclassic period we mentioned before. This period lasted until the
          classical Maya around 250 CE and the high point of Cop&aacute;n, where
          we will spend most of our time is within the Early Classic to Terminal
          Classic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The occupation of Cop&aacute;n can be dated back to around 1400 BCE.
          This has been accomplished through several excavations using different
          methods, such as random systematic stratified unaligned sampling and
          Obsidian hydration dating. Just to mention two examples. Obsidian
          hydration dating might be new to you, and you might think that you
          can&rsquo;t date a rock, or can you? Since Obsidian is vulcanic glass,
          it does have a few advantages compared to your ordinary granite when
          you want to date it. Due to its structure, it has mineral hydration
          properties, absorbing and storing a fixed amount of water that
          evaporates at a fixed time rate. If the obsidian is unworked, it
          usually contains 1% of water. When this evaporates, it leaves a small
          rind that we can see in a microscope. This dating method is limited;
          if we want an exact date, we usually need to combine this with a C-14
          or other dating method.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these earlier stages of the site, we can also see some Olmec
          influences and how the site is slowly growing into a place of
          importance. But before we get into the classical period, we learn from
          the show that the Mayans were one of the earliest civilizations that
          created a written language. But before the Mayan glyphs, we have Olmec
          writing dating to about 900 BCE. The Maya script is usually set to 300
          BCE. Sometimes you feel that the show just says things, so they sound
          older. Sure the Mayan Glyphs are earlier than Viking runes, but
          compared to Sumer and Egypt, it&rsquo;s young. They are not among the
          first or last, I would put them in the middle, and there&rsquo;s no
          judgment in that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The translation of the glyphs is a captivating story, maybe a little
          bit out of our scope at the moment. Let me know if you want us to
          revisit this. It&rsquo;s a story involving gatekeeping, saving
          manuscripts from burning buildings during world war 2, and a dramatic
          breakthrough during a conference. In the mid-1970, we could read a
          script that mainly the Catholic Church worked hard to eradicate. And
          it is a beautiful system and, unlike the Egyptian hieroglyphs, gives
          the author more creative freedom. We can currently read 90% of all
          glyphs, which is truly amazing.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The period this episode talks about takes place between 420 CE and 830
          CE. So we&rsquo;re well within the Classical period. This classical
          period started with a rebranding by a ruler named K&rsquo;inich Yax
          K&rsquo;uk&rsquo; Mo&rsquo; or Great Sun, First Quetzal Macaw. We see
          a shift and the start of the only dynasty of the site we know about;
          there were other rulers or Ajaw, but not as known as the ones
          following Yax K&rsquo;uk&rsquo; Mo&rsquo;. But he was probably put on
          the throne here by Teotihuacan, even if it seems Yax originated from
          Tikal. We have found the grave of this first ruler, so we are sure
          this is not a mythical founder we see in other locations. The
          preservation is mainly due to how they built in Cop&aacute;n. Instead
          of building new, they built on top of other constructions. Especially
          in the center where the plazas were located.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Haven&rsquo;t we had a lovely time discussing a little bit of Mayan
          history? So let&rsquo;s ruin this a bit and start dissecting what
          we&rsquo;re told in the show. After talking a bit about the site and
          Mayan script, we have Giorgio Tsoukalos join and talk about a couple
          of the stelae found around Cop&aacute;n. In most cases, these stelae
          are stone slabs with texts and often pictures. But at Cop&aacute;n,
          they are more detailed and the rulers depicted are more or less in 3D.
          They look more like statues if you see them from the front than the
          classical stelae. According to Tsoukalos, these statues &ldquo;These
          statues look like some type of a being wearing an astronaut
          suit.&rdquo; We will get to what they depict, but I just wanted to
          highlight that we again have the &ldquo;I think it looks weird&rdquo;
          argument we have seen so often. But let&rsquo;s hear what David
          Childress has to say about these statues.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >This is one of the curious dragon sculptures here at Cop&aacute;n,
            of which there are many. In fact, this very oriental statues would
            look right at place in China or some other Oriental country. Some
            archeologists believe that they are elephants on either side of this
            Cop&aacute;n ruler. So, why would there be, here at Cop&aacute;n,
            such Asian motifs as elephants and dragons in a place in Central
            America that is so far away from China and Southeast Asia? Is there
            some kind of extraterrestrial connection between the Mayans and the
            Chinese, and an origin for both that comes from the stars?</em
          >&rdquo; - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          This clearly shows that both Tsoukalos and Childress have not spent
          much time trying to understand the Mayan artwork or even read up on
          what the texts have to say. If you go to the website, I&rsquo;ll have
          some examples of these statues. But they are called Stelae A and
          Stelae B, very imaginative, I know. These works of art both depict one
          ruler of Cop&aacute;n named 18 Rabbit. 18 Rabbit, or Uaxaclajuun
          Ub'aah K'awiil, is the king who created these fantastic stelae with
          this new shape. The one mentioned by Giorgio depicts a young 18 Rabbit
          who seems to have recently descended on the throne. Looking closely,
          you&rsquo;ll note that the hands are in a delicate position, as the
          Mayans liked to depict hands. We also see several things associated
          with ascending the throne within the Mayan tradition. We have the Mat
          motif, or Pohp icon, a woven fabric associated with wealth and the
          elite. You can see this within the headdress, which we also find
          within the braids' serpent bars. We see the motif of death, sacrifice,
          and rebirth on the sides. Things that, to the Mayans, were clear signs
          of rulership; they are not trying to describe a space suit. They are
          trying to show that 18 Rabbit is, by blood, destined to rule. It
          continues to place Cop&aacute;n among the other important city-states
          Tikal, Palenque, and Calakmul.

        <p>
          Stelae B that Childress claims to have signs of the orient does not
          fare better when we start to examine it. We see 18 Rabbit again, but
          there&rsquo;s a different story going on this time. He is now a bit
          older and wants to portray a different but important idea. Here we see
          motifs of auto-sacrifice. The Mayan rulers would perform bloodletting
          rituals to get into contact with their ancestors. Mainly by cutting
          the tongue or their genitalia and drawing blood into a cup. The
          Childress elephant is, in reality, the earth monster, from which 18
          Rabbit emerges from the mouth crowned by two Macaws, symbolizing the
          supreme royalty. This statue is more about ancestors and again shows
          symbols that would not be foreign to the Mayans. The script on the
          stone does not reference people from another place, either. This stone
          is a way for the ruler to legitimize his rule. He has the right
          ancestors and, therefore, is the one who should make the blood
          sacrifice.&nbsp;

          If we look at the other Stelae, 18 Rabbit commissioned, we see the
          same theme. They all incorporate this ruler in the form of different
          gods with a theme showing that he has the right to rule. Tsouklalos
          and Childress basically argue that their pareidolia should be taken as
          truth without trying to disprove years of Mayan art history. Now they
          are limited due to the nature of TV documentaries, but I&rsquo;ve not
          seen any of them attempting to explain why the conventional
          interpretation is wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          18 Rabbit is one of the most famous ajaw&rsquo;s or kings in
          Cop&aacute;n. He was an avid constructor and is viewed as a great king
          and the beginning of the end of Cop&aacute;n. After 43 years on the
          throne, 18 Rabbit was captured and beheaded by the ruler of the
          smaller vassal state,&nbsp; Quirigua, in 738 CE. After this, there was
          no more construction within Cop&aacute;n for 18 years. Even if there
          seem to be a few attempts to get the town back on its feet, it was
          abandoned around 800-830 CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show then goes into how amazing the Mayan calendar is and that it
          is true to the solar year. Mesoamerica did have a great fascination
          for calendars. The earliest known example is from San Jose Mogote,
          dated to 600 BC. This calendar is known as the sacred calendar and
          consists of 260 days, no weeks or months. Each day consists of a
          combination of 20-day names and 13 numbers. So each day of the year
          has an individual name. But this 260 days cycle does not correspond to
          any astronomical observation. It&rsquo;s more likely tied to the human
          pregnancy that lasts nine months. The sacred calendar was later
          improved by the Zapotecs, who extended it to become 365 days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mayans did not adopt this version but kept the old sacred calendar
          and devices a second calendar more true to the sun year. This one is
          called Haab and consists of 18 months containing 20 days. If you are
          quick with math, you will realize that that only gets us to 360 days.
          That&rsquo;s because the Mayans viewed the five remaining days as
          unlucky and shunned this 19th month. The Mayans used a few more
          calendars, but we don&rsquo;t have time for them here. If you want to
          learn more, let me know, and we can do some special episode on the
          Mayans.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Ancient Aliens question the Mayans' ability to look at the stars.
          We hear the old idea that these observations could not be the work of
          these simple people. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, for working with
          naked-eye astronomy and, at best, a sighting tube, they did an amazing
          job. But there&rsquo;s nothing here that does not require patience,
          ingenuity, time, and a bit of math. The Mayans could surely do the
          math; they even had 0 as a concept. A little fun fact here is that
          their base system was 20. Philipp Coppens says something quite strange
          here to close out the section.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >When it comes to the ancient Maya that creation mythology evokes
            these legends, which say somewhere, just south of Orion&rsquo;s Belt
            is this place where life originated from and they came to planet
            Earth on 112 BC when the ancient Mayans said the gods came to
            Earth.</em
          >&rdquo; - Philipp Coppens.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, Orion's belt is a Greek star constellation, not Mayan. But the
          whole idea is rather strange, for sure. If we go to the creation story
          in Popol Vuh, we find nothing like this. We also know that the
          perceived start date of this version of human history starts at
          13.0.0.0 or when 13 baktuns had been completed. This date is part of
          the long count calendar that&rsquo;s divided into Bak&rsquo;tuns (400
          years), K&rsquo;atuns (20 years), Tuns (360 days!), and winals (20
          days). This start of humanity happened with our time count on August
          11, 3114 BCE. I have no idea where Coppens got the date here; it does
          not correspond to an event large enough to show up in my research.
          From here, we will travel across the globe to a faraway land. But
          don&rsquo;t worry, we will have to return to the Mayans later.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>Nemrud Dagi / The Magi,&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>
          One great thing about this show is that I learn about some new sites.
          This site happens to be one of those instances. Located in southwest
          Turkey, at mount Nemrud is a mausoleum for&nbsp; Antiochus I. He ruled
          a kingdom called Commagene that got its rise after the fall of
          Alexander the Great's empire. The rulers of this kingdom were like
          many other locations during this era highly Hellenized. Or greek
          wannabes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see this partly in Antiochus I mausoleum. So this site has a couple
          of components, in the center we see a large Tumulus. We have not yet
          found the burial chamber within but that&rsquo;s part of the issue
          with these types of graves. They would often need to be completely
          disassembled to be explored and I for one think it&rsquo;s good we
          have not done it yet. But as technology evolves it&rsquo;s just a
          question of when we will locate it.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <figure class="rounded float-end" style="width: 50%; margin-left: 10px">
          <img

            <p>Statues at Nemrud Dagi - Picture by Onur Polat</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We have a couple of terraces on the east, west, and north of the
          Tumulus. The northern one seems to have not been completed, maybe the
          king died too soon or something else happened. But on the east and
          west, there is a row of giant statues made out of limestone. These
          statues were originally some 7-8 meters tall (that&rsquo;s some 22 to
          26 feet) but are today in quite poor condition. It&rsquo;s the worst
          on the western terrace and can accumulate quite a bit of snow, add to
          this that the site is near a fault line and some 2000 years of
          earthquakes. The statues on the eastern side are in better condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these statues do represent gods and on the eastern platform,
          we can see Antiochos I, the goddess Commagene (probably Tyche),
          Zeus-Orosmasdes, Apollo-Mithras-Helios-Hermes, and
          Artagnes-Heracles-Ares. These are a mixture of Iranian gods and Greek,
          what&rsquo;s also interesting is that it seems as if Antiochus tried
          to blend the cultures better. These statues have Persian clothes and
          hairstyles but Greek names and faces.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are a few other details that the Ancient Alien theorists
          believe are evidence of an alien presence on the site. I&rsquo;ll let
          the show set the tone here.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >One example of the advanced knowledge of astronomy that they had is
            actually the lion horoscope, which gives us a very precise date. We
            know that the position of the stars on the lion&rsquo;s body fits
            with the positions of stars of Leo given in a book of Eratosthenes,
            who was a Greek astronomer from Alexandria who wrote a book about
            the stars.</em
          >&rdquo; - Adrian Gilbert
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The arrangement of stars on the lion horoscope represented the
            constellation of Leo as seen in the sky in July 62 BC, a
            configuration that wouldn&rsquo;t be visible again for 25,000 years.
            Further evidence of the exceptional knowledge of the stars was found
            in a nearby shaft that Antiochus built into the mountain.</em
          >&rdquo;- Narrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not far from the truth, which is, of course, refreshing in
          this series. So there is a stone slab with a lion on it with a set of
          stars that&rsquo;s been argued to be the constellation Leo. There are
          a few suggestions on what year it corresponds to but up until
          recently, the date has usually been suggested to be 62 BCE and be in
          commemoration of Antiochus' coronation. But there&rsquo;s some debate
          about if this is the correct interpretation. The star lines up at a
          few more dates such as 109 BCE and 49 BCE. In a recent article by
          Maurice Crijnc, I feel that he makes a compelling argument for the 109
          BCE date that would correspond with Antiochus' father Mithradates I's
          coronation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasons are a couple, but to start Antiochus' takes clear
          ownership of the statues he built at the site except for this tablet.
          Some pedal stones behind have text that seems to have been removed and
          can with more modern equipment be read indicating these were
          originally put up by Mithradates. The Regulus star depicted also
          indicates the date to be more likely 109 BCE. It would also work
          better with the calendar they used. But this is research published
          this year so it will be exciting to see where it goes. The site is
          quite exciting and it has room for more research and new things are
          being published about it. Yet it&rsquo;s not as famous here in the
          West as it could be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show then goes on and wonders why this was built. The idea of the
          coronation connection has been around since the 1800s but they leave
          this completely out of the episode. Instead, we are faced with this
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Given the fact that neither Antiochus&rsquo;s tomb or remains have
            been found, is it possible that the king actually journeyed to the
            stars through a heavenly gate, as Ancient Astronaut Theorists
            contend? During his life, researchers believe Antiochus studied with
            a priestly sect of Eastern astrologers called the Magi, who were
            thought to be able to predict and even manipulate events based on
            their knowledge of the stars.</em
          >&rdquo; - Narrator
        </p>
        <p>
          You might not scratch your head wondering if this is true. The answer
          is probably not and now we will get into some religious studies. So
          the term Magi is real and connected to this part of our blue marble.
          It can be used for a couple of things, Herodotus refers to a tribe
          with this name for example in <em>Histories</em>. But we also see this
          tribe with names as Madai from the Assyrians and Parsuwash among the
          Persians.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In Greece, Magi could also refer to a charlatan who used the sleight
          of hand to fool people or people who could interpret omens or dreams.
          I think it&rsquo;s quite telling that dream interpreter and charlatan
          have the same word. But it&rsquo;s also the name of Zoroastrian
          priests and from the show, it seems to be what the show is referring
          to. Listen to Jason Martell.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The Magi were renown priests from the far Near East. who had
            advanced astronomical knowledge and it&rsquo;s well known that most
            of the astronomers from the Near East specifically ancient Iraq,
            Sumer, recorded series of events happening in the heavens over
            hundreds of thousands of years. This information was kept on stone
            tablets, held very sacredly and only passed down to the high
            priests.</em
          >&rdquo; - Jason Martell
        </p>
        <p>
          The location of Madai is more toward modern-day Iran and also where we
          see Zoroastrianism originate and prosper until the Islam-Arabic
          conquest. But the Magi Martell is trying to tell us about in this case
          most likely refers to the priest within the Zoroastrian tradition.
          Even if they did spend a lot of time studying the sky their main
          interest was Astrology, not Astronomy. I know, it&rsquo;s an easy
          mistake to make but astronomy deals with studying everything above the
          earth's atmosphere while Astrology is trying to tell the future.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, the Magi were a sort of cast within the Persian empire, but
          as Zoroastrianism took over they were incorporated as priests. These
          priests started during the Classical era to spread out toward Greece
          and Sicily, this is seen in the works of Aristoteles, the astronomer
          Eudoxus and others during this era.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Zoroastrian ideas were discussed by greek philosophers and other
          learned people. So it would not be strange if a Helinized king such as
          Antiochus had read and admired them. But if we circle back to his
          statue we see that he&rsquo;s combining Greek and Persian elements.
          But not in a way that would make sense to a Zoroastrian. Even if Ahura
          Mazda and Mithra are incorporated it would from a Zoroastrian
          perspective not make sense. We see Aristoteles struggle a bit trying
          to make sense of the duality. So claiming Antiochus to be a priest is
          quite far-fetched, even if he probably understood these ideas. But
          let&rsquo;s hear how these priests are connected to alien visitors:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Today we think that the Magi were magicians and that is actually
            why we have the word magic today. But when I hear about magical
            powers, that raises a flag because magic as such does not exist. So,
            were these Magi, in fact, in possession of some type of an
            extraterrestrial technology? Because, according to the ancient
            texts, it was the initiates of each culture who were in touch with
            extraterrestrials. And it was the initiates who later became priests
            or Magi.</em
          >&rdquo; - Giorgio Tsoukalos
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we have the &ldquo;according to ancient texts&rdquo; claim again
          and I&rsquo;ve not found a good fit for them so we will just gloss
          that part over. But the type of astronomy this priest did was not
          really advanced. It takes a good view of the sky and time, maybe a
          little bit of math. Things that they clearly had at this point in
          time. But it&rsquo;s good to know that Giorgio does not believe in
          magic.
        </p>
        <p>
          From here we switch over to the story of Jesus. It is true that in the
          earlier versions the three wise men were referred to as Magi. I find
          this quite clever since the writers of Mathews (the only book where
          this story is found) are trying to cement that Jesus is the savior
          prophesied in for example Numbers 24:17. There it&rsquo;s foretold
          that the Star Prophecy will show where the king of kings will be born.
          So if you want to really hammer in that Jesus is the Jewish Messiah
          what better confirmation that the best astrology and divination
          experts saw this and followed it? Remember that they also have a dream
          where they learn that Harod was going to betray them. Again referring
          them to be experts on prophesy and dreams, skills that the Magi were
          associated with in the greek world.
        </p>
        <p>
          So these Magi saw the star, recognized it as the prophecy, and
          followed the signs they could deviate. Coming to Jesus' baby and
          giving him gifts that are usually intended for a king, confirming that
          Jesus was the right Messiah.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the birth of Jesus, we will take our leave from the Middle East
          for now and travel back across the earth to Peru.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3>The Nazca</h3>
        <p>
          Since we&rsquo;re in Peru I think you more or less can guess where we
          will end up this time. There is a bunch of wonderful cultures we could
          talk about but we&rsquo;re again back with the Nazca. Don&rsquo;t get
          me wrong, I have nothing against the Nazca but we have covered this
          culture in episodes one, three, five, and sixteen. So I&rsquo;ll offer
          a shorter version here and hopefully add some things we&rsquo;ve not
          covered in the past.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Just to set the tone and maybe offer a refresher, the Nazca culture
          was active roughly around 100 BCE to 800 CE. They were mostly an
          agricultural society with some amazing pottery. They were active more
          or less at the same time as the Moche culture. Neither of these had a
          written language that we have been able to tell. So what we know about
          them is what we have been able to uncover with the help of archeology.
          We will get to why this is important in a moment.

          But the Nazca people are of course most known for their lines. These
          lines come in all shapes, forms, and sizes, some are only 30 meters
          while others can span 48 kilometers (that&rsquo;s some 30 miles). We
          are founding new ones to this day, and with the help of drones more
          and more have been discovered as late of 2020. I don&rsquo;t have
          sources for later discoveries but I would not doubt that there are, if
          you have a source feel free to send it in.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So today we have about 1700 known figures and about 800 of them are
          straight lines. These are an enigma and we&rsquo;re not entirely sure
          what they were used for. It is some sort of ritual most likely, some
          theories relate to astronomy while others think some might indicate
          where water is for pilgrims. What we do know is that they are easy to
          make, you can just scrape your foot on the ground in this area and
          create a line. Since we find pottery shards in the Nazca style and
          sticks we know they were made by the Nazca and have an idea at least
          of how they made them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So with a few sticks and some string, you can actually make one of
          these glyphs rather easy with a few people. None of which really have
          to be up in the air for this to work. There was some experiment some
          time ago where they knitted fabric from Nazca really tight trying to
          make a balloon. Now, this succeeded to most people's surprise, but
          happiness was quickly changed to panic when strong winds took the
          ballon some 100 km of course. Now before you write me, this has been
          heavily criticized among scholars and seems to not have any anchor in
          the current understanding of the Nazca people. It would not make sense
          to them to fly to look at the glyphs since they most likely were for
          the sun. It&rsquo;s a modern solution to an ancient problem that has
          an easier solution. It does not mean that we should shun the idea but
          should be skeptical until they can make a better case for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ancient Aliens claims of course that this site was used by the aliens
          as a landing place. The Nazca people were trying to imitate the
          runways that they used. Not the issue with that is that the plains are
          really soft, not great if you want to use it as a runway. Not without
          some asphalt or something. Secondly, it does not add up with how they
          describe spacecraft in other places. They can move up and down freely
          and land on platforms at Baalbek, Jerusalem, and other places but here
          they need runways. It does not make sense and creates a whole new set
          of questions. But maybe it&rsquo;s just me overthinking things.
        </p>

          The show does not say too many new things to us, but David Childress
          does say something peculiar.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >At Nazca and other areas in Peru there are legends of Sky People
            and gods coming down from the sky.</em
          >&rdquo; David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not know what they called their gods in most cases. We have
          found representations of them such as the killer whale, the spotted
          cat, and the anthropomorphic mythical being. As you might note we do
          not know as much as we might like, but the gods they worshiped do not
          seem to fit the alien narrative. Or maybe they suggest that the aliens
          are whales and cats? It would be something interesting at least. Their
          shamans appear to have used hallucinatory drugs in their practice,
          especially the San Pedro Cactus which is represented a lot in their
          art. They did also practice headhunting, but there&rsquo;s the
          question of how much this was tied to their religion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The research on the Nazca culture is interesting and new things are
          discovered. New theories are being investigated and all of them do not
          support the ancient astronaut theory.
        </p>
        <h3>The Moai</h3>
        <p>
          From the Nazca plains we continue west out to a small island called
          Rapa Nui. Some might be more familiar with Easter Island or Isla de
          Pascua as it was named by Jacob Roggeveen in 1722. But the island has
          been settled since at least 300 CE. The name Rapa Nui is maybe not the
          island's original name but started to pop up in the 19th century.
          &ldquo;Te Pito-te-henua&rdquo; would be more precise,
          &ldquo;henua&rdquo; is traditionally translated to land, and
          &ldquo;pito&rdquo; is translated as &ldquo;navel&rdquo;. But an
          alternative translation is &ldquo;end&rdquo;, indicating that the name
          should be translated to Worlds End.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s most famous for its statues called Moai and these are of
          course the objects Ancient Aliens will focus most of this section on.
          I&rsquo;ll let the show set the tone here.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >How in the heck did they make these? Where did they come from? And
            how did they move them? Nobody has the answer.</em
          >&rdquo; - George Noory
        </p>
        <p>
          I find it a little bit dishonest that they only mention the largest
          example of the statues. On average they are about 4 meters (or 13
          feet) weighing about 14 tons. Now it&rsquo;s true that we don&rsquo;t
          know as much as we would like about these. Due to the decimation of
          the Rapa Nuis inhabitants from disease and the slave trade knowledge
          from elders has been lost in past centuries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have been wonderful to have all that lost knowledge
          preserved. In some sense, the archeology of Easter Island is more of a
          salvage excavation as some have called it. But this does not mean that
          we don&rsquo;t know how these statues were carved. You have to work
          quite a bit to ignore the evidence we have. If there&rsquo;s something
          you&rsquo;ll find excavation of the different quarry sites is tools
          and tools and tools. During the latest excavations, more than 1500 of
          these stone masonry tools have been found. These are if finished
          called Toki. They come in different forms and shapes but are made out
          of stone. Some are more elaborate than others but appear to have been
          sufficient for the work at hand. If they were not useful I hardly
          think that they would spend the time to create them at these numbers.
          But the Ancient Alien crowd again leaves all of these out from the
          episode to manufacture a mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          The quarry sites are located at a couple of places on the Island but
          the most important is Rano Raraku. So claiming that we don&rsquo;t
          know where they come from is also a bit of a manufactured mystery. But
          how did they move the statues? Well, that my friends are a bit of a
          mystery. When I say mystery it does not mean we do not have a single
          idea of how they did it. The first idea would be wood, but
          there&rsquo;s a bit of an issue there. The rampant deforestation of
          the island. If you look at the island now we see very little forest or
          trees if any. We also see rampant soil erosion causing issues on the
          island and covering things including the Maoi statues with earth. This
          happened in a fairly short span of time when we look at pollen
          analyses. But do you need wood to move the stones?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Well not really, even if it would be the most obvious tool for us.
          Especially for me as a Scandinavian who sees nothing but trees
          sometimes. But how did they move these large objects if they
          didn&rsquo;t have rollers? One theory that seems to be sound is that
          they walked. This also fits in with the oral traditions that did in
          fact survive into our age. I don&rsquo;t suggest now that they grew
          legs and moved of their own accord. Instead, you use rope and a
          prepped road. These roads are still visible to some degree and we have
          them spanning across the island. The statues are also shaped at the
          bottom to facilitate this. But you use the rope and at least two teams
          of people to rock the statue back and forth. This idea was thought up
          by Lipo and Hunt and if you go to this episode's webpage, and links in
          the show notes, you will find a clip from National Geographic. In it
          we see how a group of 18 people move a replica of a Moai statue,
          it&rsquo;s only a little bit shorter than the average. So it is
          possible to move these large statues without rollers or wood. The
          question is of course if this really was the method they used and we
          don&rsquo;t know. We might never know, but it shows that we do not
          need alien levitation guns to move them around. If we can figure it
          out today, so could the people back then. But David Childress has
          another piece of evidence

          &ldquo;<em
            >You have to ask yourself, how could the Easter Islanders have
            invented their own writing without some other cultural influence
            coming there. Would it have been ancient seafarers coming to Easter
            Island or perhaps even space visitors?</em
          >&rdquo; - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          What David is talking about here is the script Rongorongo that is
          preserved on a few pieces of wood, staffs, and a few statues. We have
          not decoded this script yet but from what we gathered so far
          it&rsquo;s most likely not a pre-contact script. We do not see this in
          earlier forms than before the Spaniards forced them to witness the
          signing of a deed of cession in 1770. While the script is fully
          developed on the island it was probably inspired in a sense by the
          contact with Spain. But the text written was supposedly sung, possibly
          sacred recitation or maybe even chants for procreation. But this was
          again lost to time and hopefully, we might be able to translate it one
          day. That would be an achievement! So we know a bit too much now to be
          suave by these claims, but they have one last claim, will it finally
          be the evidence for aliens we need?
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Did at some point in the past a creature come, which was Bird man
            who flew in from somewhere? Did he arrive on this island and did he
            indeed live very much like a pariah? Did he die or did he take off
            again, and is this what the locals keep this legend of this creature
            who came to them alive through myth, legend and ritual</em
          >.&rdquo; - David Coppens
        </p>
        <p>
          Coppens is describing a peculiar ritual that started towards the end
          times of the islands civilization. But instead of drinking a breakfast
          smoothie made of whatever you find in the fridge like Schwarzenegger
          in &ldquo;End of days&rdquo; the inhabitant of Rapa Nui developed a
          new religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we have seen the islanders had done some damage to their ecosystem,
          in earlier layers we see a lot of bird bones. At first, we can see
          some 25 different species represented in the garbage piles. Toward
          what we might consider the end of the classical era we have one
          species left. We also start to see a shift in power, from the
          ancestral worship and glory of the clan the power goes to the Matatoa.
          These are the warrior class who had a more painting name, tangata rima
          toto, or &ldquo;men with bloody hands&rdquo;. We see more charred and
          broken bones in these layers, sadly of juveniles. There is also a
          complete halt to the construction of the Moai statues that starts to
          get covered. There are indications that the statues and their ahu, the
          stone platforms some of the statues stood on, were still somewhat
          used. But their main focus had shifted to a new cult dedicated to the
          <em>manutara</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This translates to &ldquo;Sooty Tern&rdquo; and is referring to the
          last seabird on the island. These birds had their refuge on the little
          islets called <em>Motu Iti</em> and <em>Motu Nui</em> that is visible
          from the rim of the Rono Kau volcano. The ceremony took place from
          Orongo, a ceremonial village out of stone, and beside it are the
          cliffs leading straight down. Once every year there was a gathering
          where representatives from the clans competed in who could bring back
          an undamaged egg from one of the nests. The first to present such an
          egg to the elders was declared <em>Tangata Manu</em>, the birdman,
          giving his clan the glory and honor for the year. This person had then
          to go and live in a hut at the abandoned quarry of
          <em>Rano Raraku</em> for a year. I would like to close out this
          section with a quote from Grant McCall describing this ritual so well.
          &ldquo;<em
            >It is not surprising that the Rapanui, faced with an ecological
            crisis that threatened their entire social order, if not their very
            lives, should take the initiative to fashion a new religion more
            suited to their precarius times. Instead of a king for life, they
            opted for one elected by ordeal. Instead of many ancestors who
            descended from many ancestors, they propounded a single god
            (Makemake), whose image they carved in desert rocks, on the bases of
            feud-toppled figures, and even around water holes.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <h3>The Garden of Eden</h3>
        <p>
          In this last part we will talk about the Garden of Eden and how it was
          a real place. It does start out as a reasonable discussion of its
          location and one possible place would be what today is the Persian
          Gulf. Now it&rsquo;s one interpretation based on what&rsquo;s written
          in the bible, but not as solid evidence as the show maybe want it to
          be. We then have Graham Hancock claiming that:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >During that long period, there were at least three episodes of
            very, very major flooding. When you would be looking at 30 or 40
            foot rises in sea level, virtually overnight.</em
          >&rdquo; - Graham Hancock
        </p>
        <p>
          The sea level rise is a real thing that started after the last real
          Ice Age, in the show we learn that this was some 170 ft (or 51
          meters), but in reality, the rise on average was 150 meters (500 feet)
          or more in some cases. This sound like a lot and Graham Hancock and
          others use this as evidence for their great flood theories and
          whatnot. What&rsquo;s left out is that this is a process spanning
          nearly 20 000 years and often the rise was about a meter per century.
          Some periods did have a quicker pace, of nearly 2.4 meters per
          century. Then we have Scandinavia that after the glacier melted have a
          land rise instead.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          From the flood, we continue with the idea that the Bible in part is
          inspired by Sumerian sources. Since we&rsquo;ve evoked Sumer, we must
          apparently bring up the Annunaki, a modern creation by Zecharia
          Sitchin. The Annunaki is not of course invented by Zecharia but is
          part of Mesopotamian religion. He merely invented the idea that they
          were space beings, claiming that the name translates to something like
          &ldquo;those from heaven came.&rdquo; The issue of course is that
          Sitchin hasn&rsquo;t really shown that he is first of all capable of
          reading these tablets, let alone translating them. His translations
          are of course going against currently accepted translations, this
          doesn&rsquo;t mean he is in the wrong. Not at all, but it does mean he
          had to work a lot harder to prove his point. Something working against
          him a bit more is that we have Sumerian dictionaries preserved where
          they specify what the word meant.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So if we take the best current understanding of the language we would
          get a translation similar to &ldquo;Of princely seed&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;Ofspring of An.&rdquo; The Annunaki were a set of gods
          connected to the skygod An (or Anu), their creation differs from what
          culture of worship we talk about. Same for the creation of humans,
          this story differs widely depending on what source you&rsquo;re
          looking at. Is it the &ldquo;<em>Gilgamesh and the Netherworld</em
          >&rdquo; story or maybe &ldquo;<em
            >The Debate between Grain and Sheep</em
          >&rdquo; depending on which one you use you&rsquo;ll get a different
          answer to the question of how humans were created. So the idea that
          the Annunaki created humans as a slave race in the garden of Eden
          becomes quite a bit farfetched.&nbsp;
