          Something that's become more and more common on the web is the use of
          harassment tactics. Skeptics and archaeologists have not been spared
          from being on the receiving end of these campaigns, so let's have a
          serious discussion about this. I will look into the attempted
          harassment campaigns by Graham Hancock and Jimmy Corsetti and previous
          attacks concerning the Bosnian Pyramids and Gungun Padang. I will
          examine the relationship between the manosphere and pseudo-history and
          their draw into the alt-right speaking points.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Parts of the section are based on a talk by the president of
          <a href="https://www.ecso.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESCO</a
          >,
          <a href="https://www.clairek.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Claire Klingenberg</a
          >. In addition with the newly released book "<a
            href="https://www.routledge.com/The-Routledge-Companion-to-Gender-Media-and-Violence/Boyle-Berridge/p/book/9781032061368"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >The Routledge Companion to Gender, Media and Violence</a
          >" and Lucy Cookes "<a
            href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/bitch/lucy-cooke/9781804990919"

            animal</a
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, we will also look into the Asaro Mudmen and see how quickly a
          tradition can evolve. Especially when it plays into the Western
          romanticization of tribal culture. Can a tradition be copyrighted, and
          can some practices be considered a commodity? These are all valid
          questions when Asaro is trying to defend a practice that originated in
          1950.

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 46. I am Fredrik, and this is recorded in a
          hotel room in Manchester. The QED conference arranged by the
          Merseyside Skeptics has come to an end. It has been an excellent
          conference filled with fantastic talks and exciting people. Some
          presentations have, of course, triggered some thought and given some
          things to reflect on. Hence, in this episode, it is time to reflect
          and talk about some more serious things that need to be addressed
          sooner than later.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it will not be our usual dive into psuedoscience even if it kind of
          will be. It will also not be a repetition of the talks I heard
          throughout the weekend since I don't think it would be that
          interesting to listen to. So, we will first talk about literal threats
          toward the skepticism and archaeological communities. This part will
          be based in part on Claire Klingenberg's talk during Skepticamp titled
          "The Safety of Skeptical Activism." Claire's talk, and mine is still
          avalible on
          <a
            href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1932024439"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Skeptics in the Pub's Twitch</a
          >
          if you'd like to see it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          After this rather important talk, we will move on to something closer
          to what we usually do. Based on a video I saw on TikTok while waiting
          for my plane to Manchester. In this video, some sort of ceremony was
          taking place by people in weird ceramic helmets; the video referred to
          these as "The Mudmen." I thought this was not what the video claimed,
          and I was correct. So, in the other half of the episode, we will look
          into the creation of the Mudmen myth and whether a legend can be
          copyrighted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="harassment">Harassment, manosphere, and new media</h2>
        <p>
          As a warm-up for QED, the organization "Skeptics in the Pub" hosted an
          event called Skepticamp. During this event, several speakers did
          lightning talks on various subjects, from the history of electricity
          to prison escapes. If you have time and want to see them, it's still
          avalible on Twitch for a few more days; it will then be released on
          YouTube later. It was one talk that, maybe a bit ironically, touched
          on a topic again taking place towards our community. Claire
          Klingenberg is, among other things, the European Council of Skeptical
          Organisations president. Claire's talk on safety within skepticism
          happened to more or less coincide with another attack from the
          psuedoscience movement toward archaeologists and skeptics.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This new set of threats started on the 22nd of September when
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-41-atlantis-reloaded-corsetti.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Jimmy Corsetti</a
          >
          tweeted, X'ed, or what it's called now, a short message asking, "<em
            >WHY were Hitler and the Nazis so obsessed with Lost Ancient
            History?</em
          >" The tweet was accompanied by a couple of swastica-like depictions
          found in what I believe is at the Acropolis in Athens. Suppose you
          wonder why this is a problematic question. In that case, I highly
          recommend returning to
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-19-aliens-third-reich.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >episode 19, "Aliens in the Third Reich</a
          >," where I go into more detail on the connection between neo-nazis
          and these pseudoscientific claims. Corsetti has since gone on
          tweeting, "<em
            >Were you aware that so many Ancient Egyptian mummies were
            blonde-haired gingers?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Both statements, while at the surface, seem harmless, carry a legacy
          of white supremacy ideas and scientific racism that was common in the
          early 1900s. We see the connections to Jan Udo Holey or "Jan Van
          Helsing," to Norbert J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl, all three
          neo-nazis and writers of "alternative history" that influenced several
          "mainstream psuedoscientists." But we also see the legacy of our
          friend Posnansky, Ignatius Donnelly, and all the other rather racist
          theorists trying to take the credit away from people of color.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Among those who were maybe the most vocal about calling out Jimmy was
          Flint Dibble. A British archaeologist who has a large following on
          Twitter and the one who has wanted the most to debate Graham Hancock
          on Joe Rogan. I will get off the Twitter drama shortly; bear with me
          here. Dr. Dibble wrote, "<em
            >Wow, pseudoarchaeology YouTuber, Jimmy Corsetti, is fully embracing
            the dark side and openly spouting Nazi shit.... disgusting.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nothing is inherently wrong; while a more extended explanation of why
          it is problematic would be great, it's hard to get in a tweet. I've
          spent thousands and thousands on words to convey this connection for a
          reason. But this was hurtful for Corsetti, and what do people do when
          hurt? Well, they retaliate in this new media landscape. So Jimmy
          continued the discussion by putting out the contact info to Dibble's
          University, hoping that people would flood the University with
          complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not the first time the pseudoscientific crowd has instigated
          their followers to harass or attack people or organizations working
          against them. Jimmy Corsetti has in the past utilized sites like
          ratemyproffessor.com when he was annoyed by Dr. Bill Farley's
          criticism of Graham Hancock. Bill is a friend of this show and has
          been a returning guest; we talk a bit deeper about his experience
          around this in
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-31-ancient-apocalypse-ruins-of-knowledge.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >episode 31</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham Hancock has also been guilty of this. After his series aired,
          he tried to get more attention by doxing the person working at Ohio
          History Connection who denied his crew filming permit. We only saw
          their response email with his crew's contact details blacked out,
          while the representative of Ohio History's was not. We also did not
          get to see the original request from <strong>ITN Productions</strong>,
          who never has gotten back to me when requesting a comment, but it was
          left out that they had requested a multiday filming permit. The site
          could not accommodate this, and due to Hancock's past problematic
          statements, they decided to decline the permit. Hancock has never been
          barred from entering the site.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What we have discussed until now is relatively tame in comparison to
          other things that are going on. However, These things add to the
          escalation of threats and violence we see today. Just a few months
          ago, on Mykonos, an archaeologist received threatening texts just
          shortly after another archaeologist was beaten unconscious in the
          street. Surveying archaeologists in America are met with loaded guns.
          If archaeologists risk this in our day-to-day work, imagine what a
          group radicalized online could be capable of doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have already seen examples of this. Back in 2006, 21 historians
          criticized
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-20-bosnian-pyramids.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Osmanagich's Bosnian Pyramids</a
          >. The nationalistic Bosniak group quickly retaliated by harassing the
          corrupt archaeologists by email, phone, and in person. One of the more
          vocal critics and the curator of the National Museum, Zilka
          Kujundzic-Vejzagic, reported receiving many threats on the phone and
          was at one point painted as an enemy of Bosnia. Kujundzic-Vejzagic
          reported one instance where she was forced off a tram by
          nationalists.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We see the same pattern around
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-31-ancient-apocalypse-ruins-of-knowledge.html#GunungPadang"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Gunung Padang</a
          >. Archaeologists and other scholars who criticized Dr. Hillman's
          project were silenced. It, of course, did not help that the most
          prominent financier of the project was the government. This led to a
          culture of silence that only benefits the psuedoscience crowd, and
          this is the goal they strive towards.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what should you do then if you face threats or learn that someone
          you know receives them? Claire Klingenberg, I think, put this in a
          concrete and reasonable step-by-step manner.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Get a buddy, right. Get a friend, get someone you trust to go and
            or even a threat of bodily harm to report it to the police because
            this process is really difficult. You have to explain what it is
            that you do, which, you know, as skeptics, that's never going to be
            easy to start off with.The next thing is to explain why you've
            become a victim of a threat and to make sure that it's being taken
            seriously. And some threats are more imminent. Some are just kind of
            random. We know we have many personalities within our community that
            had to move addresses because of how badly they were addressed. We
            know, for example, Urns had to have his mail checked by the police
            because there were anthrax threat threats to him and everything.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          We can't forget that men, women, and non-binary don't face the same
          type of harassment or the same levels. We men tend to have it easier
          in a way compared to many women and non-binary people.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >As female activists, we do face a different type of type of threats
            online, and it's usually, well, just name calling is different
            because they're much it's much more focused on how we look. And then
            of course, the threats are of sexual violence, which is something
            our male counterparts don't really face as much.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          In a 2017 survey, 21% of women 19-29 reported having been sexually
          harassed. 53% in the same group have received illicit sexual pictures.
          I'm not sure why these are not included in the sexual harassment, but
          anyway. A UNESCO survey among female journalists reports that 70% of
          this group have experienced online violence. 20% also say that this
          has led to real-world altercations where they have been approached by
          people threatening them online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something worth noting is that there is a crossover between the
          alternative history crowd and the manosphere. Young, conservative, and
          predominantly white men are getting radicalized online, and often,
          they seek out these people who promote the idea of the existence of a
          white being a culture-bearer race. But it's not only these talking
          points they often take, but also trying to use history and archaeology
          to promote manosphere ideas such as gender. We often see this in the
          discussion regarding skeletons and gender. The alt-right manosphere
          often touts that archeologists or osteologists cannot provide the
          identified gender. That gender is only binary, a view not
          representative of modern science. Using the Victorian model as a base
          for gender will lead science to be held back, as Lucy Cooke shows in
          "Bitch: A revolutionary guide to sex, evolution and the female
          animal." This idea of woke archaeologists is then reported in
          conservative media and pseudoscientific sources like Ancient
          Origins.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The alt-right has a highly well-coordinated online presence. These
          ideologies are also great in using people with interests in
          conspiratorial ideas and alternative science for their own agenda. But
          as Debbie Ging, Professor of Digital Media and Gender, points out,
          social media platforms are currently radicalizing white men through
          their algorithms. Also, they have a vested interest in promoting these
          topics since "Hate online triggers interaction and traffic, which
          translates into economic revenue for platforms." Something that become
          increasingly clear with Twitters/X new revenue sharing models.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've noted all of these while reaching out to potential guests: people
          who are not white males often decline due to fearing harassment or
          more harassment. This is corroborated in an article from
          Sciencescience where they interviewed Stephanie Mulder, Sarah Head,
          and others. All women reported being harassed; Stephanie Mulder, as an
          example, describes how she got knife emojis sent to her. I will let
          Claire in again to see what to do after receiving threats or
          harassment.

            There's a if you feel strong enough, then please do. Because these
            people love to live in the darkness and once you bring them out to
            the light, they stop being so brave. So if you unless there is a
            direct and unless you get a direct command from the police not to do
            so, please do share these kinds of experiences. And these kinds of
            threats on social media and share, if you can, with journalists to
            show, number one, you have to show that being a science
            communicator, science popularizer, a skeptic is not something that
            can go without any kind of. That it does come off as a reaction that
            people are afraid of facts sometimes, so much so that it does get to
            this point. And the more you share your story, the safer you make.
            People around you, because then their their stories are taken more
            seriously when you go out and speak about yours. Definitly seek out

          I wish I had a solution to this issue, but we can support each other,
          and if you happen to be a public skeptic or archaeologist, please
          report your threats. While it might be cumbersome, it might help
          someone else that you took the time and made the police understand
          what you are going through. We can also help by discussing these
          issues and bringing them out in the light. These people love to
          operate in the shadows. They will lose some power if their methods
          come out in the light. But the most crucial part is to make sure you
          are safe. If you don't feel safe, step back and return when you feel
          ready again. What should we do next? Well, we need to start talking
          about these subjects and bring it forward; the more open we are, the
          more supportive we can be and figure out ways to combat this together.
        </p>
        <h2 id="asaromudmen">The Asaro Mudmen&nbsp;</h2>
        <p>
          So, let's leave this subject and go on to something a bit closer to
          what we usually do. So, this all started with a short film I watched
          while lazily scrolling, waiting for the other passengers to fight
          their way onto the plane. The film claims to show a tribe from New
          Guinea who wears strange-looking masks while smeared in mud and
          wearing loincloths. The masks look evil and seem to be made out of
          ceramic with almost demonlike faces carved into them. The story that
          accompanied the video went something like this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "During one of the many tribal fights, the inhabitants of Asaro came
          off worst. The survivors saved themselves on the muddy banks of the
          river, where they hid until nightfall. When they, completely covered
          with light mud, tried to sneak away quietly, they were observed by the
          enemy, who thought they were the avenging ghosts of the killed. The
          enemy panicked and fled. The Asaro, surprised by the effect of their
          unintentional make-up, developed it as a war strategy, a kind of
          psychological warfare, and created mudmasks."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The video also states that this tribe is almost unknown and has
          baffled anthropologists who can't explain it. So, with all this, my
          skeptic senses started to tingle and lead me down a rabbit hole on how
          a modern myth is birthed from convenience and pure luck. It also
          created the legal question: can a tradition be copyrighted?
        </p>
        <p>
          To start with, the tribe in question is doing the "unkown" part
          entirely wrong since they have been featured in commercials for
          Toyota, Orange Soda, and airlines. But they have also been portrayed
          on album covers such as Pink Floyds, "<a
            href="https://live.staticflickr.com/8466/8438628002_4791715df0_b.jpg"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Obscured by Clouds</a
          >," and "House Techno 2."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The tribe from Papua, New Guinea, was known before that. We see in the
          1970s Western writers expanding on the myth and adding more elements
          to the lore. Some came to connect the masks with a demon that helped
          the tribe, giving them eyes to kill. Others will claim that they wear
          the masks and dance to eliminate demons. In a relatively poor BBC
          article, it's claimed that the masks originate from a wedding attendee
          who could not find suitable clothes. So he created the mask for some
          reason, and everyone thought he was a ghost and fled. So, all the
          classical colonial ideas can be found as the tradition's origin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Is it possible to know the origin of the tradition then? Ton Otto and
          Robert J. Verloop, two anthropologists, did in 1996 go and look for
          the true source of the practice. They did find something rather
          interesting while doing so.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          They went to the small village of Komunive, located in Asaro Valley,
          with the closest larger city being Goroka. There they met the
          "big-man" of the Asaro Mudmen, Ruipo Okoroho. Ruipo was kind enough to
          tell the real story behind their tradition.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It all started at the end of the 1800s when Ruipo Okoroho's
          grandfather, Bukiro Pote, decided to leave the village of Kabiufa to
          live in the Watabung area for some time. During his time in the
          Watabung area, Bukiro learned some new costumes from his neighbors.
          One happened to be a practice the people called bakime. You see when
          you are very upset with a neighbor or rival village, you might want to
          extract some good old street justice. But while doing so, you don't
          want to be recognized, so you try to conceal your identity. In a time
          when Nixon or pig masks, not sure why I made a distinction there, were
          pretty rare, the people in Watabung covered their identity with the
          help of a white sap from the "Meniha" tree.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bukiro Pote returned to his village with these new practices. Bukiro,
          when returning, changed the practice's name to girituwai, and instead
          of using tree sap, he constructed masks out of a bamboo frame, a sack,
          with mud smeared on top of this. One could only speculate about these
          changes; maybe the tree was not widely avalible in the area, or Bukiro
          felt this method was better.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not only these people who used colors to change their
          appearance; other people in the High Lands, for example, used charcoal
          to paint their bodies to look more fierce during combat. This practice
          is connected to the belief that ancestral spirits accompany the
          warrior into battle and a need to conceal your identity from the
          opposing warriors. So, we have a connection with some of the modern
          retelling; remember this as we go forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Smearing mud on you is an act associated with grief and mourning
          within the Highlands. But other tribes also used mud to honor fallen
          fighters when they returned to battle, and white mud has been
          associated with spirits. So, we find a lot of bits and pieces that
          have been woven into the modern Western retellings.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the ceramic masks we see today have not yet been invented;
          remember, the girituwai masks were simple frames with a sak and mud.
          But this would change in 1957 when Ruipo Okoroho was invited to bring
          his people to dance in the Eastern Highlands Agricultural Show. During
          the event, there would be a singsing competition. Singsing is a form
          of dance performance, and the Asaro people were asked to compete.
          While the Asaro do have a fine dance pedigree, Ruipo Okoroho suggested
          that they should resurrect his grandfather's idea of girituwai. Some
          changes were made, and the masks got more elaborate and closer to what
          we see today. When the group entered the fairgrounds, they performed
          quite a spectacle and won the competition. During the event, more of
          the Mudmen legend started to grow. Another tribe called Ifi Yufa
          provided the Asaro with a song to accompany their dance and a name for
          the figure "holosa." This word translates to ghosts.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the tradition is, in reality, something very new. Between 1957 and
          1964, the Holosa dance was only performed once a year, and that was at
          the Eastern Highlands Agricultural Show. But after 1964, the Asaro
          tribe also started to put on a show in Komunive village. Ruipo Okoroho
          acted as a sort of middleman between the village and tour organizers,
          arranging mudmen sightseeing tours. To sell the tours, the story about
          the Asaro Mudmen expanded and grew yet again. We see a waving of
          stories based on tribal warfare, supernatural spirits, and ancestral
          beliefs being added and adoring themselves with clay and mud. All
          things that fit well into the Western idea of the primitive savage.
          Then, the tour guides continued to expand on the concepts and quote
          each other without acknowledging it until we had the story presented
          today.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the invitation to a dance competition has turned into quite a
          lucrative tourist attraction that, of course, has generated a bit of
          competition. While we know that many tribal societies have an idea of
          ownership regarding nonmaterial or intellectual goods. This includes
          weaving patterns, designs, rituals, and concepts of spirits. Often,
          the different tribes will leave these concepts and immaterial rights
          alone. But in a world where tourism has become a large business and a
          way to make a good income for many of these people, these rituals have
          become a somewhat commodity. This has led to Ruipo Okoroho, who claims
          to have the copyright to the practice, appearing in court to defend
          his claim to the copyright. We see this quite clearly in the BBC
          article I mentioned previously. The journalist talked with three
          Mudmen performers at Sydneys Australian Museum back in 2016, and one
          of the performers, named Kori, said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The government does not recognize or protect our ownership rights and
          everyone in the highlands is now claiming to be a mud man." "But it's
          our story, and the others have copied it from us. It is a big worry
          for us because we don't have any copyright protection."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ruipo Okoroho was in court several times during 1980, successfully
          arguing his right to the origin of the rite. Even the Watabung people
          claimed to own the source due to the inspiration from Bakime. But it
          was established that girituwai is its own rite. It has since led to
          infighting between Ruipo and others within the village. A man named
          Atairo claims to have been the one who changed the masks from banana
          root masks to clay masks. This seems to split the village into
          different camps where younger inhabitants prefer Atairo's narrative
          over Ruipo's.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the story is new, it does offer us a chance to see how a ritual
          and myth can form. With it first appearing in 1957, we can follow how
          it changes and how the performers are turned into something older and
          grander. While most of the legends seem to be fueled by tourist money,
          it does not invalidate the ritual and how it's formed. It is a
          fascinating journey into the birth of a practice. Even if the original
          story does not fit as well into our Western idea of how tribal culture
          is formed, we can learn a lot from this case study.&nbsp;
