          This is the finale of our summer special. The second part of Lucian of
          Samosata's novel “A True Story.” While the first part is filled with
          space travels and battles on distant planets, this part will deal with
          other topics. What was Homer's true nationality, why Pythagoras didn’t
          like his victory meal, and if Herodotus were sent to the Greek version
          of hell for his accounts?
        </p>
        <p>
          Lucian of Samosata, a second-century CE author, penned what some
          consider the first science fiction novel in history, "A True Story."
          Lucian vividly describes space travel, intergalactic battles, alien
          beings, and even alien abductions in this short story. However, rather
          than attempting to write a sci-fi epic, Lucian's work is a satirical
          critique of contemporary travel books and historical accounts. In this
          episode, we'll continue to look at Lucian's imaginative narrative and
          see how it gives us a unique window into the ancient world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. The podcast where we examine
          strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in popular
          media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there
          better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 67, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. I am still out traveling, but today, we will
          finish our story with Lucian of Samoa. If you don’t remember the story
          we’re dealing with, it is one of the earliest intended descriptions of
          space travel. So, last time, we saw Lucian sailing in space,
          participating in a space battle, and getting eaten by a whale. After
          realizing that creatures lived inside the whale, Lucian and his men
          killed them all. So we pick things back up again inside a giant whale.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          After a while, we grew tired of living inside the whale, and our
          prolonged stay began to bother us. So, we started brainstorming ways
          to free ourselves from this captivity. Our first idea was to dig a
          hole through its right side and escape that way. We worked hard on
          this, but after digging about a kilometer deep and realizing it was
          pointless, we gave up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we decided to set the wood on fire, figuring that it would
          definitely kill the whale, making our escape easy. We put this plan
          into action and started the fire at its tail. The fire burned for
          seven days and nights before the whale even felt it. By the eighth and
          ninth days, we noticed the whale was getting sick; it gaped more
          sluggishly than usual and closed its mouth quicker.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the tenth and eleventh days, the whale was seriously sick and
          started to stink. On the twelfth day, we realized, almost too late,
          that unless we propped open its jaws the next time it gaped, we risked
          being trapped forever inside its dead body and perishing miserably.
        </p>
        <p>
          We propped the whale's mouth with long wooden beams to keep it from
          closing. Then, we started to prepare our ship, stocked up on fresh
          water and other necessities, with Scintharus acting as our pilot. The
          following day, the whale died. We navigated our boat through the
          passages in its body, secured cables around its teeth, and gradually
          lowered it into the sea. We climbed onto the whale's back, offered
          sacrifices to Neptune, and camped by our monument of triumph for three
          days since there was no wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the fourth day, we set sail again and encountered many corpses from
          the recent sea battle. Our ship bumped into these bodies, which we
          measured with great curiosity. We sailed for several days in calm
          weather until a bitter north wind brought a severe frost. The sea
          froze solid, not just on the surface but to a depth of about 730
          meters. We had to abandon our ship and walk on the ice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unable to bear the cold, we followed Scintharus's idea and used
          hatchets and other tools to carve out a large cave in the ice. We
          sheltered there for forty days, made fires, and ate the plentiful fish
          we found while digging. When our supplies ran low, we returned to our
          frozen ship. We set it upright, raised the sails, and slid smoothly
          over the ice as if on water. On the fifth day, the weather warmed, the
          ice melted, and the sea returned to water.
        </p>
        <p>
          We sailed about 55 kilometers until we reached a small deserted
          island. We replenished our fresh water, which was running low, and
          hunted two wild bulls with our weapons. These bulls had horns growing
          under their eyes, a feature Momus had suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we sailed into a sea of milk and discovered a white island full
          of grapevines. This island turned out to be a large, well-pressed
          cheese, around 4.6 kilometers in size. The grapevines produced not
          wine but milk. In the middle of the island, as indicated by an
          inscription, was a temple dedicated to Galatea, one of Nereus's
          daughters.
        </p>
        <p>
          During our stay, the island provided us with food, and we drank the
          milk from the grapes. The island was said to be ruled by Tyro, the
          daughter of Salmoneus, who received this reward from Neptune after her
          death.
        </p>
        <p>
          We rested on this island for five days. On the sixth day, we set sail
          again, aided by a gentle breeze, with the sea calm and still. By the
          eighth day, we were no longer sailing in milk but in clear, salty blue
          water. We spotted many men running on the sea. They looked just like
          us in every way except for their feet, which were made of cork. This
          peculiar feature gave them the name "Phellopodes."
        </p>
        <p>
          We were amazed to see them stay afloat and move so confidently on the
          water. They approached and greeted us in Greek, explaining they were
          heading to their homeland, Phello. They ran alongside us for a while
          before turning off in their own direction, wishing us a safe and
          prosperous journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, we saw many islands. To our left was Phello, the city they
          were traveling to, on a massive, round piece of cork. Further off to
          the right, we saw five other large, mountainous islands with burning
          fires. Directly ahead of us was a flat, spacious island about 92
          kilometers away. As we neared it, a wonderfully fragrant breeze,
          reminiscent of the scents described by Herodotus from Arabia the
          Happy, wafted over us. The air was filled with a delightful mix of
          roses, daffodils, gillyflowers, lilies, violets, myrtles, bay leaves,
          and vine blossoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delighted by the smell and hopeful for better fortunes after our long
          journey, we approached the island. It had numerous large, safe harbors
          and clear rivers flowing into the sea, surrounded by meadows, herbs,
          and musical birds singing both on the shore and in the trees. A gentle
          breeze stirred the woods, creating a continuous, pleasant melody
          similar to wind instruments in a quiet place. There was also a
          harmonious sound like a joyful banquet, with some playing music, some
          praising it, and others clapping along.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enchanted by all this, we entered the harbor, moored our ship, and
          disembarked, leaving Scintharus and two companions to guard it. As we
          walked through a lovely meadow, we were met by the island's patrols,
          who captured us and bound us with garlands of roses, their strictest
          form of restraint. They led us to their governor, Rhadamanthus,
          explaining that we were on the island of the blessed. We were taken to
          be judged and placed fourth in line among those awaiting judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first trial that day involved Ajax, the son of Telamon, and
          whether he should be allowed to join the Society of the Heroes. The
          objections against him were his madness and his suicide. After much
          debate, Rhadamanthus ruled that Ajax should be placed under the care
          of Hippocrates, the physician from Cos, and treated with hellebore. If
          he recovered his sanity, he would be admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second case was a dispute over Helen between Theseus and Menelaus.
          Rhadamanthus ruled the case in favor of Menelaus, citing the many
          labors and dangers he faced for Helen's sake. In contrast, Theseus had
          other wives, such as the Amazon and the daughters of Minos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third case was a matter of precedence between Alexander the Great
          and Hannibal of Carthage. Alexander was given preference, and his
          throne was placed next to Cyrus the Elder of Persia.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were the fourth to appear. Rhadamanthus asked why we, as living
          men, had entered this sacred land. We recounted all our adventures in
          detail. After considering our story for a long time and consulting
          with the other judges, including Aristides the Just, Rhadamanthus
          finally spoke. He decreed that we would be held accountable for our
          curiosity and unnecessary travels after our deaths. For now, we were
          allowed to stay and feast with the Heroes for seven months, after
          which we had to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our rose garlands then fell off on their own, and we were released and
          led into the city to feast with the blessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city was made entirely of gold and surrounded by a wall of
          emeralds, with seven gates carved from a single piece of cinnamon
          wood. The city's streets and all the ground within the walls were
          paved with ivory. The temples of the gods were constructed from beryl,
          and their large altars were made from whole pieces of amethyst, used
          for sacrifices. A river of the finest sweet ointment, 45 meters wide
          and deep enough to swim in, flowed around the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had large bathhouses made out of glass and heated with cinnamon.
          Their bathtubs were filled with warm dew instead of water. Their only
          garments were made from purple cobwebs. They had no physical bodies
          but were mere shapes and forms. Despite being bodiless, they stood,
          moved, were intelligent, and could speak. Their souls appeared to
          wander in a bodily form; unless touched, one would think they had
          bodies, looking like upright shadows but not dark in color. No one
          aged there; they remained the same age as when they arrived. There was
          neither night nor clear day but a perpetual twilight, like the light
          just before sunrise. They experienced only one season, spring, with
          Zephyrus as the only wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The region was full of flowers and pleasing plants for shade. Vines
          bore fruit twelve times a year, once each month. Pomegranate and apple
          trees bore fruit thirteen times a year, twice in the month called
          Minous. Instead of wheat, their fields produced ready-baked loaves of
          bread, similar to mushrooms. Surrounding the city were 365 wells of
          water, an equal number of honey wells, and 500 wells of sweet
          ointment. They also had seven rivers of milk and eight rivers of wine.
        </p>
        <p>
          They held their feasts outside the city in a field called Elysium, a
          pleasant meadow surrounded by dense woods that provided shade. Guests
          sat on beds of flowers and were served by the winds, except for the
          wine, which didn't need filling. Around the banquet area, large trees
          of clear, pure glass grew, with their fruit being drinking cups and
          other vessels of any shape or size. Each guest would gather one or two
          of these cups, which would instantly fill with wine for them to drink.

        <p>
          Instead of garlands, nightingales and other musical birds gathered
          flowers with their beaks from the nearby meadows. Flying over the
          guests, the birds scattered the flowers among them while chirping
          beautiful tunes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are anointed with sweet ointment in this manner: clouds draw the
          ointment from the fountains and rivers, and when these clouds settle
          over the heads of those at the banquet, the slightest breeze causes a
          gentle rain to fall on them, resembling dew. After supper, they enjoy
          music and singing. The most popular songs are verses from Homer, who
          is present and feasts among them, sitting just above Ulysses. The
          choirs consist of boys and virgins, directed and assisted by Eunomus
          the Locrian, Arion the Lesbian, Anacreon, and Stesichorus, who have
          been there since his reconciliation with Helen. Once they finish, a
          second choir of swans, swallows, and nightingales takes over. The
          forest resonates like wind instruments stirred by the breeze when they
          conclude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two wells near the banquet area add to their joy: one for laughter and
          the other for pleasure. Everyone drinks from these at the beginning of
          the feast, which ensures the entire time is spent in merriment and
          laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will tell you about the notable figures I saw there. All the
          demigods and all who fought against Troy were present except Ajax the
          Locrian, who they said was tormented in the region of the unrighteous.
          Among the barbarians were Cyrus the Elder and the Younger, Anacharsis
          the Scythian, Zamolxis the Thracian, and Numa the Italian. Also
          present were Lycurgus the Spartan, Phocion and Tellus the Athenians,
          and all the Wise Men, except Periander.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus, chatting with Nestor and
          Palamedes. Nearby were Hyacinthus the Spartan, the handsome Narcissus,
          and Hylas, among other beautiful youths. Socrates seemed particularly
          fond of Hyacinthus, speaking with him more than anyone else. This
          behavior annoyed Rhadamanthus, who often threatened to banish Socrates
          from the island if he didn't stop his foolish jesting at their
          banquets. Plato was not present, as he was said to dwell in a city of
          his design governed by the laws he prescribed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aristippus and Epicurus were prominent because they were the most
          pleasant and friendly. Diogenes the Cynic had changed so much that he
          married Lais, the courtesan, and often got so drunk he would dance
          around wildly. Aesop the Phrygian served as their jester. Not a single
          Stoic was there, as they were busy climbing the heights of virtue.
          Chrysippus was reportedly not allowed to enter the island until he had
          purged himself with hellebore four times. The Academics wanted to come
          but were skeptical about the island's existence and reluctant to be
          judged by Rhadamanthus, having abolished all kinds of judgment. Many
          desired to go and followed those heading there, but their slothfulness
          made them turn back halfway.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were all the notable men I saw there, with Achilles regarded as
          the best among them, followed by Theseus. As for their manner of
          intimacy and relationships, they coupled openly with both males and
          females without any shame. Only Socrates claimed his relationships
          with young men were platonic, but no one believed him. Hyacinthus and
          Narcissus openly admitted otherwise, despite Socrates' denials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Women were shared among all men, and no one objected to this, making
          them the best Platonists in the world. Boys also willingly offered
          themselves to any man's pleasure without objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          After spending two or three days like this, I took the opportunity to
          speak with the poet Homer. During our free time, I asked him about his
          origins, a topic that had long puzzled us. He said he himself was
          uncertain because some claimed he was from Chios, others from Smyrna,
          and many from Colophon. However, he revealed he was Babylonian,
          originally named Tigranes. The Greeks called him Homer when he lived
          among them as a hostage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also inquired about the disputed verses in his works, asking if they
          were indeed his. Homer confirmed they were all his, criticizing
          Zenodotus and Aristarchus, the grammarians, for their poor judgment.
          When I asked why he began his poem with "anger," he said it happened
          by chance, not by premeditation. I also questioned whether my new
          friend wrote the "Odyssey" before the "Iliad," as some believed, but
          Homer confirmed it was not. Regarding his alleged blindness, I soon
          realized it was untrue, as he clearly could see.
        </p>
        <p>
          I often visited Homer with many questions, which he always answered
          freely. He especially enjoyed discussing a trial he won in court,
          where Thersites had sued him for mockery in his poem. Homer was
          acquitted, with Ulysses serving as his advocate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around this time, Pythagoras the Samoan joined us. He had undergone
          seven different lives and transformations, completing the cycles of
          his soul. The right half of his body was made entirely of gold.
          Everyone agreed he deserved a place among them but debated whether to
          call him Pythagoras or Euphorbus. Empedocles also arrived, his body
          scorched as if broiled on embers, but despite his pleas, he was not
          admitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time passed, the day for the games of athletic prowess, called
          Thanatusia, approached. Achilles organized the games for the fifth
          time and Theseus for the seventh. A detailed explanation would take
          too long, so I'll highlight the main events. A Hercules descendant,
          Carus defeated Ulysses in wrestling and won the garland. The boxing
          match ended in a tie between Arius the Egyptian, who was buried at
          Corinth, and Epius. I don’t think there was any prize for the
          Pancratium, and I can't recall who won the running event; MMA and
          jogging have never been my cup of vine. Despite Homer's undisputed
          skill, the prize went to Hesiod for poetry. All prizes were garlands
          made of peacock feathers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the games ended, we received news that the damned souls from the
          realm of the wicked had broken free, escaped their jailers, and were
          coming to attack the island, led by Phalaris the Agrigentine, Busyris
          the Egyptian, Diomedes the Thracian, Sciron, Pituocamptes, and others.
          Hearing this, Rhadamanthus arranged the Heroes in battle formation on
          the shore, led by Theseus, Achilles, and Ajax Telamonius, who had now
          regained his senses. They engaged in battle, and the Heroes emerged
          victorious, with Achilles displaying exceptional valor. And positioned
          on the right wing, Socrates showed himself to be a braver soldier than
          he had been in his lifetime, notably in the Battle of Delium. When the
          enemy charged, he neither fled nor changed expression. For his
          bravery, Socrates was awarded a beautiful, spacious garden in the
          city's suburbs, which he named Necracademia. There, he invited many to
          discuss philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We captured the defeated prisoners, bound them, and sent them back to
          face even harsher punishments. Homer documented this battle and gave
          me the manuscript as a keepsake to show my friends, though I later
          lost it along with many other things. However, I remember the first
          verse: "Tell me now, Muse, how the dead Heroes fought."
        </p>
        <p>
          After their victory, it was customary for them to feast on boiled
          beans in celebration. Only Pythagoras abstained, sitting apart and
          missing the meal because he could not stand beans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Six months had passed, and we were halfway through the seventh when a
          new situation arose. Cinyras, the son of Scintharus, a tall and
          handsome young man, had fallen deeply in love with Helena, and she
          felt the same about him. They exchanged looks and drinks during
          feasts, often left alone together, and wandered through the woods. As
          their affection grew, Cinyras planned to elope with Helena to one of
          the nearby islands, Phello or Tyroessa. He conspired with three of the
          boldest members of my crew but kept his father in the dark, knowing he
          would punish him.
        </p>
        <p>
          One night, when I had fallen asleep at the feast, they seized their
          chance. They slipped away with Helena and onto the ship as quickly as
          possible. Menelaus awoke around midnight, discovered Helena was
          missing, and raised an alarm. He and his brother went to
          Rhadamanthus's court.
        </p>
        <p>
          At dawn, scouts reported seeing a ship far out to sea. Rhadamanthus
          dispatched a vessel made from a single piece of asphodelus wood,
          crewed by fifty Heroes, to pursue them. The Heroes were so swift that
          they caught up by noon as the fugitives entered the Milky Ocean near
          Tyroessa, nearly escaping. We captured their ship, towed it back with
          a chain of roses, and brought it ashore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rhadamanthus interrogated Cinyras and his companions. They confessed
          there were no other conspirators. They were sentenced to be tied by
          their private parts and sent to the place of the wicked for torment
          after being scourged with rods made of mallows. Helena, ashamed and
          tearful, refused to show her face. We were also ordered to leave the
          country as our time was up. We were to depart the following day. I was
          deeply grieved, weeping bitterly at the thought of leaving such a
          wonderful place and becoming a wanderer again. They comforted me by
          saying I would return someday and showed me a chair and bed prepared
          for me among the elite.
        </p>
        <p>
          I went to Rhadamanthus, asking him to reveal my future and guide me.
          He predicted that I would eventually return home after many travels
          and dangers, though he didn't specify when. He pointed to the five
          nearby islands and a sixth further away, explaining that the nearest
          ones were the islands of the ungodly, always burning with light fire.
          The sixth island was the island of dreams, and beyond that, the island
          of Calypso, which was out of sight. He told me that after passing
          these, I would reach a great continent opposite my homeland, face many
          hardships, encounter various nations, and meet men of inhuman
          conditions before finally reaching the other continent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rhadamanthus handed me a mallow root, instructing me to pray to it in
          my greatest perils. He also advised me never to stir the fire with a
          knife, eat lupins, or approach a boy over eighteen. Remembering these
          instructions would increase my chances of returning to the island.
        </p>
        <p>
          We prepared to leave, feasting with the Heroes at the usual hour. The
          following day, I visited Homer, asking him to compose an epigram for
          me, which he did. I erected a beryl stone pillar near the harbor and
          inscribed the epigram. It read:
        </p>
        <p>"Lucian, the gods' beloved, did once attain</p>
        <p>To see all this, and then go home again."</p>
        <p>
          After one more day, we set sail, accompanied by the Heroes. Ulysses
          discreetly handed me a letter for Calypso on the isle of Ogygia,
          ensuring Penelope didn't see. Rhadamanthus sent Nauplius, the
          ferryman, with us to ensure our safety if we landed on those islands,
          as we were on a different mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          No sooner had we passed beyond the sweet-smelling area than we were
          hit by a horrid stench, like burning pitch and brimstone, with an
          unbearable scent as if people were being roasted on hot coals. The air
          became dark and murky, dripping with a pitchy dew. We also heard the
          crack of whips and the screams of the tormented. Although we didn't
          visit all the islands, we did land on one with this dreadful
          appearance: it was surrounded by steep, jagged rocks with no wood or
          water. We scrambled up the cliffs and followed a path overgrown with
          briars and thorns through a ghastly landscape. When we reached the
          prison and place of torment, we were amazed at the nature of the land,
          which produced no flowers but only swords and daggers. Surrounding it
          were several rivers: one of dirt, another of blood, and the innermost
          of burning fire. This fiery river was broad and impassable, flowing
          like water and churning like sea waves, filled with various fish—some
          as large as firebrands, others smaller like coals of fire—called
          Lychniscies.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was only one narrow entrance, guarded by Timon of Athens, but
          with the help of Nauplius, we managed to get in. Inside, we saw many
          being tormented, both kings and commoners. Among them was Cinyras,
          tied by his private parts and suspended in the smoke. The worst
          torments were reserved for those who had lied and written falsehoods
          in their lifetimes, like Ctesias the Cnidian and Herodotus. Seeing
          this, I felt hopeful that I would never end up there, as I didn't
          recall ever telling a lie. We quickly returned to our ship, unable to
          endure the sight any longer, and bid farewell to Nauplius, sending him
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, we approached the Isle of Dreams, a dim and elusive land,
          much like dreams themselves. The island seemed to recede as we neared
          it, appearing farther away than when we first saw it. Eventually, we
          reached it and entered the harbor called Hypnus, near the gate of
          ivory, where the temple of Alectryon stands. We landed late in the
          evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon entering the gate, we encountered many dreams of various forms.
          But first, let me describe the city, as no one else has provided a
          good description; even Homer only briefly mentioned it, with little
          detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city is surrounded by a dense wood of extraordinarily tall poppies
          and mandragoras, home to countless owls—the only birds on the island.
          Nearby runs a river called Nyctiporus, and at the gates are two wells
          named Negretus and Pannychia. The city's high wall changes color like
          a rainbow and has four gates, not just two, as Homer mentioned. Two
          gates face the fields of sloth, one made of iron and the other of
          potter's clay, allowing passage for dreams that represent fear, blood,
          and cruelty. The other two gates face the harbor and the sea, one made
          of horn and the other of ivory, which is the one we entered through.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon entering the city, we saw the temple of the Night on the right,
          where the inhabitants revere Night and Alectryon above all gods.
          Alectryon also has a temple near the harbor. On the left stands the
          palace of Sleep, who is the sovereign king over all and has appointed
          two great princes to govern under him: Taraxion, the son of Matogenes,
          and Plutocles, the son of Phantasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the center of the marketplace is a well, named Careotis, flanked by
          two temples: one of Falsehood and the other of Truth. Each temple has
          a private cell for its priests and an oracle, where Antiphon, the
          chief prophet and interpreter of dreams, presides. Sleep appointed
          Antiphon to this place of honor.
        </p>
        <p>
          These dreams varied greatly in nature and shape. Some were long,
          beautiful, and pleasing, while others were short and deformed. Some
          appeared as golden and splendid, while others seemed poor and
          beggarly. Some had wings and monstrous forms, while others were grand,
          as if in a triumph, depicting kings, gods, and other notable figures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the dreams were familiar to us, having been seen by us before.
          They greeted us as old friends, lulled us to sleep, and entertained us
          with lavish feasts. They promised to make us kings and princes and
          took us home to show us our friends, only to return us the following
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          We spent thirty days and nights among them, sleeping and feasting
          until a sudden clap of thunder woke us all. Startled, we gathered
          provisions and set sail again. On the third day, we landed in Ogygia.
          During the journey, I opened the letter I was to deliver and read its
          contents:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ulysses to Calypso sends greetings. I want to inform you that after I
          departed from you on the vessel I hastily made, I suffered shipwreck
          and barely survived with the help of Leucothea, reaching the land of
          the Phaeacians. They sent me home, where I found many suitors wooing
          my wife and squandering my wealth. I killed them all but was later
          slain by my son Telegonus, whom I fathered with Circe. Now, I am in
          the island of the blessed, daily regretting my decision to leave you
          and forsake the immortality you offered. If I find the opportunity, I
          will slip away and return to you."
        </p>
        <p>
          The letter also mentioned us, stating we should receive a warm
          welcome. Not far from the shore, I found the cave Homer described, and
          there was Calypso, busy with her wool. Upon receiving the letter, she
          wept bitterly but welcomed us warmly and treated us to a meal. She
          asked many questions about Ulysses and Penelope, wondering if she was
          as beautiful and modest as Ulysses often boasted. We answered in ways
          we thought would please her.
        </p>
        <p>
          After resting near the shore, we set sail in the morning, only to be
          caught in a violent storm that tossed us for two days. On the third
          day, we encountered the Colocynthopiratans. These wild men, who preyed
          on travelers, used large gourds, about three meters long, as their
          ships. They hollowed out the gourds and used the rinds as boats, with
          masts made of reeds and sails of gourd leaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          They attacked us with two ships, wounding many of us by throwing gourd
          seeds instead of stones. The battle was evenly matched until noon,
          when we saw the Caryonautans approaching. The Colocynthopiratans
          turned to fight their enemies, giving us the chance to hoist our sails
          and escape. The Caryonautans, with five well-furnished ships made from
          split and cleaned nutshells, each about 27 meters long, likely won the
          day due to their superior numbers and more robust vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we were out of sight of the battle, we tended to our wounded men
          and decided to stay armed at all times, fearing another sudden attack.
          This caution was justified because, before sunset, we were approached
          by about twenty more pirates riding on massive dolphins that carried
          them securely. These dolphins neighed like horses when ridden. As they
          neared, the pirates split into two groups and began hurling dried
          cuttlefish and sea crab eyes at us. We fought back, injuring several
          of them, which caused them to retreat to the island, most of them
          wounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around midnight, in calm seas, we unexpectedly encountered a massive
          halcyon’s nest, about 12 kilometers in circumference, where the
          halcyon herself was nesting. She was nearly the size of the nest, and
          when she spread her wings, the gust almost capsized our ship,
          accompanied by her mournful cries as she flew.
        </p>
        <p>
          At dawn, we climbed onto the nest and discovered it was constructed
          like a large barge woven together with trees. Inside were 500 eggs,
          each more prominent than a Chios tun and close to hatching, with
          visible, chirping chicks inside. Using an axe, we cut open one egg and
          found a featherless chick that was already larger than twenty
          vultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          About 37 kilometers away from the nest, we encountered alarming omens.
          The carved goose ornament on our ship’s stern suddenly sprouted
          feathers and began to cry. Scintharus, our bald pilot, instantly grew
          a full head of hair. Most bizarrely, our ship's mast began sprouting
          branches and bearing unripe figs and grapes. Disturbed by these signs,
          we prayed to the gods to avert any impending disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
          After traveling another 92 kilometers, we came upon what seemed to be
          a vast forest of pine and cypress trees. It appeared to be land, but
          it was a sea of immense depth with floating trees that stood firm and
          upright on the water without roots. We were at a loss, as navigating
          through the dense trees was impossible, and turning back safely seemed
          equally unlikely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I climbed to the top of the highest tree to see what lay beyond. The
          forest stretched about 9 kilometers, and I saw another ocean beyond
          it. We decided to try lifting our ship onto the dense tree leaves and
          cross to the other ocean. Using a solid cable, we wrapped it around
          the tree tops and managed, with great effort, to hoist our ship up and
          place it on the branches. We then spread our sails, and with the help
          of the wind, we moved forward, dragging the boat along the treetops.
          This reminded me of a verse by the poet Antimachus about sailing over
          the tops of trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once we crossed the forest and reached the sea again, we lowered our
          ship as we had raised it. We sailed on clear waters until we came to a
          massive gulf or trench in the sea, resembling the great clefts seen on
          land after earthquakes. We struck sail, and our ship halted abruptly
          at the edge of the trench, which seemed to be about 185 kilometers
          deep, a terrifying sight. The water appeared to be divided into two
          parts. Looking to our right, we saw a water bridge connecting the two
          sides. We rowed towards it with considerable effort and crossed over,
          much to our relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          A calm sea greeted us on the other side, and we found an island
          inhabited by wild men called Bucephalians, who had horns on their
          heads like the Minotaur. We went ashore searching for fresh water and
          provisions, as ours were depleted. We found water but nothing else. We
          heard loud bellowing and roaring nearby, which we thought might be a
          herd of cattle. As we approached, we encountered the Bucephalians.
          They chased us back, capturing three of our crew while the rest fled
          to the sea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determined not to leave our friends unavenged, we armed ourselves and
          attacked the Bucephalians as they were dividing the bodies of our
          slain comrades. We put them to flight, killed fifty, and captured two
          alive. However, we found no food. The crew wanted to kill the
          prisoners, but I suggested we keep them as hostages until the
          Bucephalians sent ambassadors to ransom them. This indeed happened. By
          their nodding heads and mournful lowing, I understood their request.
        </p>
        <p>
          We agreed on a ransom of various cheeses, dried fish, onions, and four
          three-legged deer (two legs behind and one in front). We released the
          captives on these terms and left the next day. Soon after, we saw
          signs of approaching land: fish in the sea, birds flying overhead, and
          other familiar sights.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then encountered a novel form of navigation: men traveling on the
          sea using their bodies as both ship and sailor. They lay on their
          backs in the water, using their large, erect, privy members as masts
          to which they attached sails. Holding the ropes in their hands, they
          let the wind carry them wherever they wished.
        </p>
        <p>
          After these followed others riding on cork chariots, pulled by two
          yoked dolphins, which they drove like coachmen. These travelers did
          not offer us any harm, nor did they avoid us. Instead, they peacefully
          accompanied us, marveling at the size of our ship and examining it
          from all sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the evening, we arrived at a small island inhabited only by women
          who spoke Greek. They greeted us warmly, shook our hands, and wore
          long mantles down to their feet, looking young and beautiful. The
          island was called Cabbalusa, and the city was named Hydramardia. The
          women welcomed us, each taking one of us as a guest. However, I felt
          uneasy and noticed the bones and skulls of many men lying together in
          a corner. I decided not to alarm my crew or arm ourselves immediately.
          Instead, I took the mallow and prayed earnestly for protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon after, when one of the women came to attend to me, I noticed that
          she had the hoofs of an ass instead of human legs. I drew my sword,
          captured her, and questioned her. Reluctantly, she confessed they were
          sea women called Onosceleans, who fed on travelers. She explained that
          they would get their victims drunk, sleep with them, and then kill
          them in their sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon hearing this, I left her bound and went to the house's roof,
          calling my crew to me. I told them everything I had learned and showed
          them the bones. I brought them to the woman I had tied up, but she
          suddenly turned into water and disappeared. However, it turned to
          blood when I thrust my sword into the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hurried back to our ship and set sail. We saw the mainland at dawn,
          which we believed to be the country opposite our continent. We
          worshipped and prayed, then debated our next steps. Some suggested
          landing and returning to our ship, while others wanted to leave and
          explore inland to see how the inhabitants would react. During this
          discussion, a violent storm drove our boat against the shore, smashing
          it to pieces. We swam to land with great difficulty, each grabbing
          whatever we could.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can recount these events, from our time at sea, our journey to the
          islands, our adventures in the air, our time inside the whale, and our
          experiences with the Heroes, the dreams, the Bucephalians, and the
          Onosceleans. What happened on land after this will be told in the
          following books.
