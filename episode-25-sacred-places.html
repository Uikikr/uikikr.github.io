          This time we&rsquo;re traversing the world between different sacred
          places. Could there be evidence for alien visitation within these holy
          places and the religious texts associated with them? During this
          episode, we will visit Jerusalem, Saudi Arabia, India, Ethiopia, and
          lastly, Lebanon. We look into the claims presented in Ancient Aliens
          and compare them to the available knowledge.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We will look at religious texts, engineering techniques, and what you
          might find when you go on a tiger hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode is based on the claims in Ancient Aliens episode four of
          season three called "Aliens and Sacred Places" (S03E03).

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 25. This will be quite
          the odd episode since it&rsquo;s not too crazy. This is one of the
          rare moments we have some decent documentary-making. But don&rsquo;t
          worry, we will find some strange claims and investigate what the show
          has left out. This episode will focus on holy places and will take us
          on tour between Israel &amp; Palestine, Saudi Arabia, India, Ethiopia,
          and Syria. I think you can figure out some of the locations quite
          quickly. Let&rsquo;s see if you did manage to guess them all.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m recording this episode not long after attending the QED
          convention of 2022 in Manchester, England. It was a brilliant
          experience, and the organizers wonderfully planned the event with many
          exciting talks. I had a lot of meaningful and fun interactions with a
          lot of people during the weekend. If you want to attend a skeptical
          conference, this is one I genuinely recommend. I did one speech on
          Friday during an event by the Sceptics In the Pubs, and it should be
          as a VOD on their twitch for a few more days. I&rsquo;ll link this in
          the show notes and later add the youtube version if it drops.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I also got some feedback from listener Mike who caught that I
          said that the Great Sphinx is made of sandstone. What I was supposed
          to write and say was limestone. I was thinking a bit too much about
          sand and got mixed up. It&rsquo;s fixed in the show transcript. Mike
          also highlighted that the sleeping prophet&rsquo;s name is pronounced
          Kayce. Good catch, Mike; thank you for helping to create a great
          resource to find information about misinformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you will also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions; I
          want to highlight that if you see something, please add a good source.
          And if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I&rsquo;ve heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3 id="templemound">Temple mound</h3>
        <p>
          We start this episode on the Temple Mound, and there&rsquo;s nothing
          too crazy for quite some time here. The Temple Mound is important for
          the Abrahamic religions; the big three within this category are, of
          course, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Ancient Aliens do a decent
          part of TV documentary here. It is as if some archeologist did some
          guerilla editing in all of this. But so far, so good, to be
          honest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if you&rsquo;re not too familiar with the Temple Mound,
          it&rsquo;s not to overstate that this place is the holiest place on
          earth for the Jewish people. The temple mound is believed to be Mount
          Moriah or Morrya from Genesis 22, where Abraham bound Isaac.
          It&rsquo;s also the location of Solomons Temple, which we will get to
          in a moment, and the Universe's origin. This stems from the Foundation
          Stone, located today inside the &ldquo;Dome of the Rock&rdquo;,
          thought to be the location where God stood and the location of the
          Holy of Holies inside Solomon's temple.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to tradition, the first temple was completed during the
          reign of Solomon somewhere in the 10th century BCE. The location of
          the temple was first acquired by king David for the price of 50 pieces
          of silver. The location was, according to scriptures, a threshing
          floor. A threshing floor is where a farmer separates the cereal from
          the stalks.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          But King David was not allowed to build the first temple since he
          &ldquo;had spilled to much blood.&rdquo; I find it a bit unfair since
          it was on the order of God, but anyway. The task fell upon Davids's
          son Solomon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m not sure then if the show by accident mixes up Mount Moriah
          and Mount Sinai, but we get the following quote from Van D&auml;niken.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >In the Bible you read about the Ark of the Covenant. Moses was
            ordered to go to the Holy Mountain and the Lord gave Moses
            instruction to construct the Ark of the Covenant. As we know later,
            the Ark of the Covenant was something very, very dangerous.</em
          >&rdquo; - Van D&auml;niken.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple was mainly built to store the &ldquo;<em
            >Ark of the Covenant,</em
          >&rdquo; replacing the Tabernacle used since Egypt. In the show, they
          focus a lot on the fact that only the High Priest was allowed inside
          the Holy of Holies. This is true, the High Priest was only allowed
          inside Yom Kippur to make the required offerings. To become a high
          priest, we learn in Leviticus 21 that you need to be, for example,
          free of blemishes, can&rsquo;t have a crooked back, or have anything
          too long. Not sure what they mean with the last part, but you&rsquo;re
          free to fill it out as you please.
        </p>
        <p>
          So from Solomons's temple, we move toward the magical items possessed
          by king Solomon. We will now have a little confusion since Ancient
          Aliens is trying to handle written sources. The narrator claims that
          in the Talmud, there is a passage about Salomon possessing a magic
          ring branded with the Seal of Salomon, which today is known as the
          Star of David. When possessing the ring, the owner could control
          demons, according to the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Talmud is an important document within Judaism and is the source
          of Jewish Law and Theology. Usually, when referring to the Talmud,
          you&rsquo;re talking about a collection of writings within the
          Babylonian Talmud. But you could also refer to the Jerusalem Talmud or
          the six orders of Mishnah. Within, we find two sections, a written
          compendium of the Oral Torah and the Gemara. The latter part is an
          expansion of the Hebrew bible containing later Jewish history but also
          customs, ethics, folklore, and many different topics. All in all, the
          Talmud consists of 63 tractates, you could also call them sections,
          and usually spans over 3000 pages. It&rsquo;s massive work, so finding
          a section without guidance can be hard. But I did manage to locate the
          story referenced in the Talmud. I&rsquo;m using the Koren Talmud
          Bavli, translated by Adin Even-Israel Steinsaltz. If we head to
          Tractate Gittin, Chapter 7, and sections 68a and 68b, we find a story
          about Salomon and a ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Solomon sent for Benayahu, son of Jehoiada, a member of the royal
            entourage, and gave him a chain onto which a sacred name of God was
            carved, and a ring onto which a sacred name of God was carved</em
          >&rdquo; Git. 68a
        </p>
        <p>
          This Benayahu is then sent out to capture a demon called Ashmedai, and
          after tricking the demon, the young man captures it and brings it back
          to Solomon. The king then ordered the Ashmedai to build the Temple
          alone. The story seems to be a way to explain the passage in 1 Kings
          6:7, where it&rsquo;s claimed no hammer or chisel was heard from the
          building process. Except the text mentioned before that all the stones
          were dressed and cut at the quarry. So I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why
          they needed a demon to staple the blocks. The Talmud hten claim
          Solomon was tricked by the demon who then usurped the throne while
          Solomon is doomed to a life of poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can find the idea of the Seal of Solomon in the work of Flavius
          Josephus, a Roman-Judeo historian. In his work Antiquities of the
          Jews, we find the idea of the ring expelling demons but it&rsquo;s
          described as&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >He put to the nose of the possessed man a ring, which had under its
            seal one of the roots prescribed by Solomon</em
          >&rdquo; Ant. 8.46&ndash;47
        </p>
        <p>
          We don&rsquo;t get a specification of what the seal was, but instead
          it talks about the wisdom of Solomon and it is the roots that cause
          the demon to flee. We must look toward the &ldquo;Testament of
          Solomon&rdquo; to find a more detailed story. This document is still
          debated if it&rsquo;s a Christian or Judaic text, it contains elements
          of both. The version containing the chapter on the demons is called
          the Vienna Papyrus and is dated to around 500 CE. It is also the
          oldest surviving text of the versions we have available. Within
          chapter 18 we can read about how Solomon used the seal to call up and
          interrogate demons. They are then set to work building the first
          temple as a sort of punishment relating to their domain of torture.
          But the star of David seems not to be associated with the seal until
          after Arabic scholars worked on the story. It&rsquo;s possible that it
          was then incorporated back into the Jewish tradition in Spain during
          the Morish rule.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I think that the evolution of this story is highly fascinating and
          didn&rsquo;t go the way I thought from the beginning. But as you can
          assume, it differs a bit from this episode's thesis. That when they
          talk about demons, they mean Aliens. But as you note from the written
          accounts, it specifically speaks about demons who do not work freely.
          They, or as we noted in the Talmud only Ashmedai, were forced by the
          ring to obey the commands of Salomon. Or, as Flavius indicated,
          Solomons's wisdom of medicine compelled them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is religion, and I would not suggest taking these stories as
          literal truths. But if the Ancient Alien people want to claim that the
          original sources have a different meaning they need to properly back
          this up. In this episode, they don&rsquo;t really make a great job of
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Solomon is associated with other magical items such as a flying
          carpet. The show claims that according to Arabic texts the wise king
          had a flying carpet made out of green silk that could hold Solomon's
          army. But here we get a Giorgio Tsoukalos who suddenly turned skeptic:
        </p>

            >Now, magic carpets, do they exist? Of course not. So, what was it
            that our ancestors try to describe in those stories.</em
          >&rdquo; - Giorgio Tsoukalos
        </p>
        <p>
          David Childress, a to us now familiar alienist, joins in answering
          this question that it must have been a spaceship. Of course, it must
          have been. Or was it? We do find this story in the Quran or the
          Islamic texts as the show calls them, but in most stories, the
          emphasis is on Solomon or Sulayman's ability to control the wind. We
          see this in Sura 21:81 for example and Islamic scholars claim that
          this is a reference to sailing. Not a flying carpet, but I found some
          text mentioning a wooden mat. But it still sounds like a boat to me,
          or maybe a boat as one would describe it to someone who has not seen
          one. We also have accounts in the Bible, 1 king 10:22, that talk about
          Solomon&rsquo;s trade operation. Adding up the evidence and the fact
          that the show just made some stuff up I think it&rsquo;s more
          reasonable that this is trying to explain the success of the trading
          operations.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also get a bit of Sir Isaac Newton here who was a man of science
          and mystery. Back then it was not uncommon that the scientific method
          included what we view today as very unscientific ideas and methods.
          But Newton who didn&rsquo;t believe in the trinity had a fascination
          with the temple in Jerusalem. He did in his writing have a portion
          called &ldquo;Notes on the Temple&rdquo; in which he seems to have
          looked deeper into the Temple. To Newton, it symbolized a heliocentric
          depiction, where the altar in the Holy of Holies was the sun and the
          temple and courtyard were the other planets in the universe. He also
          thinks that the Temple Mound will be the place where the apocalypse
          starts. With this in mind, it makes Bill Birne's quote rather strange
          in regards to Newton's work:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >It was very highly advanced architecturally catching certain kinds
            of light, being very precise in his astronomical alignment. And the
            question for modern scholars and architects is, what was the level
            of technology available to King Solomon that allowed him to design
            and lay out the temple according to these principles.</em
          >&rdquo; &ndash; Bill Birnes, J.D., Ph.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bible does provide highly detailed descriptions of the temple in
          both 1 Kings and 2 Chronochels. Unfortunately, some of the terms have
          lost their original translations. But historians, archeologists, or
          architects do not seem to struggle with the level of the technology
          described. It is more a linguistic discussion at this point and some
          other Jewish temples have been found that some argue fit this
          description. So Bill would need to be more specific for us to look
          deeper into this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show seems to be finished with the Jewish side of the Temple Mound
          and then goes on trying to shoehorn in Christianity. But it ends up
          just being basically about the ascension of Jesus. So since he went
          up, alien spacecraft must have taken him. I don&rsquo;t feel we really
          need to go into this argument since we have done it in the past. The
          Christian connection isn&rsquo;t as strong either to the temple mound.
          You have the story of the money lenders and it&rsquo;s thought that
          Jesus' circumcision took place here. But the Church of the Holy
          Sepulchre quickly took over as the important place for Christians in
          Jerusalem. That&rsquo;s for example why the templars used the Dome of
          the Rock as a living quarter rather than restoring it to a church.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, we&rsquo;ll go over the Islamic claim to the site.
          al-Haram al-Sharif or the Nobel Mound is important within the Islamic
          Faith since it&rsquo;s today believed to be the place for Mohammed's
          ascension to heaven. Even if the Quran in Surah Al-Isra 17:1 only
          states the site to be &ldquo;<em
            >the Farthest Mosque whose surroundings We have blessed</em
          >&rdquo; many have since then interpreted this to be Al-Aqsa mosque.
          The foundation stone has also been incorporated into the faith as the
          exact location where Mohammed stood when Jibril took him to heaven.
          But why have we really spent all this time on this site? There have
          not been that many aliens so far. I&rsquo;ll let Giorgio explain this
          to you:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;That stone signifies the coming together of the kingdoms of
          Heaven and Earth. The problem is, we&rsquo;ve forgotten that whoever
          visited us in the past wasn&rsquo;t God, but it was
          extraterrestrials.&rdquo; - Giorgio Tsoukalos
        </p>
        <p>
          So the idea here is that since the site is quite square and that the
          Foundation stone has a godly connection it must have been a spaceport.
          It&rsquo;s interesting how they can so easily rule out God as a
          spiritual being while keeping faith in extraterrestrials. The idea
          that it was a spaceport seems quite far-fetched and the construction
          of the Temple of Salomon is relatively recent. Why don&rsquo;t we see
          depictions of aliens in texts or art in the area from that time? Why
          would they put a temple in the landing port? It just comes off rather
          silly, to be honest, here.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mecca">Mecca</h3>
        <p>
          From Jerusalem, we travel to the next holy site, Mecca or Makkah
          al-Mukarramah. The early history of this city is disputed, and we
          don&rsquo;t know as much as we would like. But by the time of Mohammed
          and the rise of Islam, it had grown into a locally important place. A
          part of it was the trading that happened in the city but it was also a
          religious center where people came on pilgrimage even before Mohammed.
          The chief god of the pre-Islamic Arabic tribe was Hubal. According to
          the information we have there were some 360 statues around the Kabaa,
          so it must have been a quite large pantheon. Well, there&rsquo;s been
          some time without Bill Birnes who can fix that.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Muslims pray in the direction of Mecca five times a day. So,
            certainly, as a holy shrine, it is the center of the Earth. A
            Heaven&rsquo;s gate, where the opening of Heaven takes place. And
            that&rsquo;s why it is so revered.&rdquo;</em
          >
          -Bill Birnes
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, this is not crazy but problematic. The reason why the Kaaba is
          holy is not due to it being some portal to heaven but because
          it&rsquo;s Allah's symbolic residence on earth. The origin of the
          Kaaba isn&rsquo;t Islamic, the Kaaba was there with the 360 statues we
          mentioned earlier. We&rsquo;re not entirely sure how old the building
          is, but according to Islamic tradition, it was built by Abraham and
          Ishmael. There might not be too much evidence for that but it&rsquo;s
          clear that Mohammed incorporated this important building in the town
          where he grew up into his new religion. In the texts, he is supposed
          to have destroyed the old idols. But none of this does match Birnes
          idea, all of it seems to speak to the opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show gives us some information about the Grand Mosque, the largest
          one in the world, and a bit about the Kaaba. We get some descriptions
          about the Hajj, the pilgrimage all financially and physically able
          Muslims should participate in at least once.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we start to talk about the black stone located on the east corner
          of the Kaaba. Known as the al-拷바jaru al-Aswad or &ldquo;Black
          Stone&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s a piece of black stone fitted in a silver
          frame today and was part of the Kaaba even before Mohammed. There is a
          tradition in early Arabic faith to mark places of worship with an
          unusual stone. The stone's origin is unknown but some within the faith
          claim it to come from angels or falling from paradise to mark where
          Adam and Eve should build an altar. But the show proceeds with the
          following quotes.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >If so, what does that say about the historical and possibly
            metaphysical origins of the Islamic faith?</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >It&rsquo;s kind of strange really that other Muslims are all
            praying towards Mecca and to this black stone that&rsquo;s there.
            There are stories that the Kaaba in Mecca is radiating some kind of
            energy. That it energizes people and increases their spirituality
            and health. Perhaps it&rsquo;s coming from this meteorite, this
            black stone of extraterrestrial origin.</em
          >&rdquo; - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          So we&rsquo;re back with Childress energy claims. Childress is sure
          that this is a meteorite but the right answer is that we do not know.
          Due to a number of reasons, including that the stone has been
          desecrated a couple of times, the Islamic people have not allowed the
          stones to be scientifically studied. Why would they? The stone is
          sacred for a number of reasons, none of them involving spiritual
          energies. There are a number of theories though and the most common
          are natural glass, basalt, agate, or maybe a meteoric rock. We have an
          account from 900 CE when the stone had been stolen and when it was
          returned it was recognized due to its ability to float. If this
          account is true, it&rsquo;s more likely glass or a more porous stone.
          My opinion that does not matter too much, so don&rsquo;t use it in a
          paper, but is that it kinda looks like obsidian. I did find some
          geologists thinking the same but not as in publishing a paper on it
          kind of level.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then get a claim that the Kaaba lines up with three astronomical
          things, a star named Canopus, the moon cycle, and the winter and
          summer solstice. How could these ancient people have this advanced
          knowledge? This is a bit simpler since the building is square and the
          different astronomical phenomena is matching one of the different
          sides. You don&rsquo;t need astronomical calculations to mark out
          where something will happen if you have seen it before.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a repeating of the Angels mean alien that we discussed back in
          Episode 14 with Tine Rassalle. But we will leave the Islamic world
          here. We don&rsquo;t really get the clear spaceport connection here
          but I assume that it was this they were hinting at.
        </p>
        <h3 id="ajanta">Ajanta Caves</h3>
        <p>
          Now we&rsquo;re taken to the mystical land of India. A British officer
          named John Smith, I promise he is real, stumbles through the jungle on
          the hunt for the majestic tiger. But he finds something completely
          different. A cave complex carved out of the mountain dedicated to
          Buddha. Or Smith claims to have found it while in reality at least
          cave no ten had been known among the locals for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have some decent documentary filming, and they are on-site talking
          with local guides. The Ajanta Cave complex is a Buddhist Monastery
          carved directly into the maintain in the&nbsp; Aurangabad district in
          the western part of India. It&rsquo;s on UNESCO&rsquo;s World Heritage
          list and is a beautiful location. The site was built in two main
          phases, the earliest part is probably around 100 BCE and the second
          phase was started around 400 CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside the cave, we see different traditions, thoughts, and ideas from
          the Buddhist faith represented. In the earlier caves such as 9, 10,
          12, 13, and 15A, we see depictions from Jataka Tales. These are
          stories about Gautama Buddha native to India, since Buddha can
          remember earlier lives he can use them to teach. So in them, he can be
          a king, an animal, a criminal, a deva, or something else. In these
          stories, an often large cast usually gets into trouble but the Buddha
          manages to solve things in the end, and you get a happy conclusion. In
          the later caves, we see depictions from the Mah캐y캐na tradition within
          the Buddhist faith. The other large tradition is called Therav캐da,
          it&rsquo;s also the oldest tradition. Today it&rsquo;s the dominant
          religion in for example Thailand, Laos, Cambodja, etc.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >There are many different sculpture subjects at Ajanta. Many of the
            sculptures are of the Buddha. In addition to those sculptures, there
            are various depictions of other mythological beings. These are
            called Jatakas. These Jatakas show these previous lives, and these
            lives could be related to, say, the Buddha being born as an animal,
            being born as a deity, or being born as a human.</em
          >&rdquo; &ndash; David Efurd, Ph.D.
        </p>
        <p>
          We even have Dr. David Efurd in the show, telling us parts about the
          Jataka tradition. So to repeat, it&rsquo;s not too strange. We have
          David Childress walking around on-site, but other than that,
          it&rsquo;s again not too bizarre. Compared to what we have seen in the
          past, this feel like some sort of vacation. But then we get to the
          misinformation
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Even today, modern engineers are baffled as to how the caves
            could have been cut from the 70-foot-high </em

        </p>
        <p>
          Since this is an audio medium, you can&rsquo;t see but you should go
          ahead and google Ajanta Caves. I&rsquo;ll wait, go ahead, you
          won&rsquo;t miss anything. If you&rsquo;re driving, just stop.
          There&rsquo;s an exit over there. Don&rsquo;t google and drive. Now,
          if you did as I told you, you probably saw at least the outside of the
          complex. You might have noticed that the rock almost looks folded as
          if nature scooped it like a soft serving or whipped cream. That
          indicates that it is not granite, and the fact that the statues are
          sometimes more pitted than a teenager's face also indicates that this
          is not granite. But the rock is basalt and it&rsquo;s a vulcanic rock
          and is due to this not as dense and hard as for example granite.
          I&rsquo;m not sure why they decided to go with granite in the clip,
          but this is common with the Ancient Alien crowd to exaggerate
          claims.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The caves were most likely excavated from top to bottom, that way you
          do not need scaffolding and can work easier. What you had to do was to
          measure it out and then work yourself down. The workers used tempered
          iron chisels combined with a sledgehammer. They most likely operated
          in teams, so one help the chisel trying and trying not to anger his
          co-worker. The other would swing the hammer down on this soft rock.
          The debris was taken away and discarded mostly by women most likely as
          we see examples of even today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though we haven't found a forgotten chisel in the caves we do
          have chisel points that have broken off and the fact that metalwork
          had been around in India since at least 1800 BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have examples of unfinished caves showing us how they plotted and
          excavated the cave. If you start to look at the carvings you&rsquo;ll
          also note that in some cases they were changed suddenly due to the
          porous stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the show brings back the idea of ancient people having advanced
          astronomical knowledge. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s David Efurd who
          brings up that cave 19 and cave 26 are aligned to the different
          solstices. Now, why did I say, unfortunately, here? It turns out that
          cave 19 is not aligned with the solstice. They tried to align it, but
          this idea came too late in the building process. Dr. Walter Spink
          writes.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The only problem with this wise procedure in Cave 19 is that the
            whole cave was later wrenched toward a never-achieved alignment with
            the solstitial axis</em
          >&rdquo; (Spink 2006 p. 240)&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But both caves 26 and 29 have proper alignment. A little fun fact
          here, we do know the cave's patrons' names. So this was not paid for
          by the monks or by labor as some sort of offering. Cave 19 was ordered
          by Upendragupta a local king and Cave 26 was paid for in part by
          Buddhabhadra to commemorate a previous chief minister. These two caves
          were created more or less simultaneously, cave 19 was started just
          maybe two years before. One hypothesis on why Upendragupta
          didn&rsquo;t get a proper solstice alignment is that they tried to
          change the plan too late in construction. They heard about
          Buddhabhadra's plan way too late but thought that it would work. The
          workmen did their best, but to be honest we&rsquo;re not sure why they
          attempted this sudden change. Maybe pride, optimism, or the fact when
          your ultra-wealthy patron tells you to jump you jump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now being wrong about something does not mean everything is lost. But
          with this in mind it does make David Childress's statement a bit,
          let&rsquo;s say weird.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Now, this would have been very difficult to do, itself, because
            you&rsquo;re cutting solid rock from inside of a cave. So, you would
            need some pretty high-tech gear in order to tunnel and build and
            chip away inside of solid rock in order to really be perfectly
            oriented to the solstice.</em
          >&rdquo; - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          As we saw, the precision was a bit off. But the solstice does hit the
          Stupas in caves 26 and 29. Interestingly, both of these also show
          signs of being changed midway to accommodate this idea. As mentioned
          earlier, we have evidence of the tools and methods they used to
          construct the different caves.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jason Martell fills us in on how the Stupas symbolize Buddha's
          descent and ascend to heaven. If you have paid attention, this is the
          point where we should think of rockets. Just as with Jesus and
          Mohammed. I&rsquo;m not sure what expert Martell did consult about
          this, but I have a vague guess that it was located in his mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stupas are a common phenomenon in Buddhist building tradition and are
          usually domeshaped structures containing relics and a place for
          meditation. These structures stem from earlier traditions of Tumilis.
          Within Buddhism, it&rsquo;s believed that the Buddha himself asked for
          his remains to be enshrined within eight stupas. When his disciples
          asked what a stupa was and how it looked Buddha had put his robe on
          the ground and put his begging bowl over it. The stupas have since
          evolved and changed a bit depending on the country and culture. But as
          you note this is again quite far away from what we were presented with
          by Martell.
        </p>
        <p>
          To close this section out we have to other white guys trying to
          explain another culture poorly. Or well, if they can&rsquo;t
          understand it by just looking at it, well then it has to be aliens
          involved.

            >The Ancient Astronaut Theory suggests that if we find paintings or
            carvings of half men half animals, that that means that those
            creatures at one point really existed because they were genetically

          Some of these are mythological creatures called Kinnara. Usually
          depicted as a half-person and half-bird and are in most cases female.
          They have the bottom half of a bird and the upper body of a human.
          They are not evil but are said to bring protection and well-being.
          They don&rsquo;t even come from the sky but live in forest regions,
          some connected to mountainsides. But as we have seen with Ancient
          Aliens and myths, they have a tendency to rework it quite a lot.&nbsp;

        <h3 id="lalibela">Rock-Hewn Churhces of Lalibela</h3>
        <p>
          Well, it&rsquo;s time to move again, so let&rsquo;s say goodbye to
          India for now and head over to the dark continent of Africa as I think
          many personalities in this series call it way too often.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with the Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela in
          Ethiopia, you will not be in a moment. Because this is the next
          subject of investigation. These structures are not built traditionally
          with blocks from down to up. Neither are they carved as caves into a
          mountain. These churches are megaliths carved out of the mountain.
          There are eleven of them in this Lalibela, but across Ethiopia, there
          are nearly 200. Unfortunately, many of them are not in the same good
          condition as the Rock-Hewn Churches in Lalibela.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an issue of dating these naturally, but scholars agree that
          the churches in Lalibela were created somewhere between 700 CE to 1200
          CE. According to tradition, all these eleven churches were built by
          King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, who lived between 1181&ndash;1221.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the narrator claims that these structures are scientifically
          unexplainable by engineers, no less! What engineers did you ask?
          Don&rsquo;t worry about that; let&rsquo;s go over to David Childress.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >When you see the churches of Lalibela, you can see that they are
            using what probably have to be power tools. Anytime you&rsquo;re
            cutting hard stone, you&rsquo;re looking at specialized cutting
            tools; you need iron tools. Even today, we would have to use power
            saws and grinding wheels and chisels</em
          >.&rdquo; - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever we hear the show say it&rsquo;s a hard rock, we can usually
          assume it&rsquo;s some sort of volcanic rock and be right; in most
          cases. In this case, most of the rock is basalt. A quite soft rock
          that&rsquo;s compared to other types of stones quite easy to work
          with. If you would go and look up these churches you&rsquo;ll start to
          note that they are not as exactly cut as the show portrayed.
          It&rsquo;s a bit weird to hear them talk about how perfect it&rsquo;s
          cut and see that it&rsquo;s crocked. But for not having laser tools,
          power saws and I don&rsquo;t know the Ethiopians did a great
          job.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But I do not get how Childress thinks that there were no iron tools in
          Ethiopia at the construction time. It&rsquo;s true that ironwork
          arrived later in the Sub-Sahara continents, but by the time of the
          construction of these churches, iron was in fact in use. We
          don&rsquo;t need iron per see to quarry rock as we mentioned in the
          past, you just need a harder stone. Also, Denys Stocks who do a lot of
          experimental archaeology, has shown that flint chisels can very likely
          have been used. If you go to our website diggingupancientaliens.com
          you&rsquo;ll be able to find a clip of Stocks and a stone mason
          cutting rock with flint.

          We then go into the legend of the creation of the churches that
          included the king being taken to heaven by Gabrial. There God sat him
          down and told the king that he needed to build these churches. Back on
          earth, the king started the construction and with the help of angels
          who took the night shift, according to Bill Birnes, completed the
          churches.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >To me, that is a very fascinating story, because, in my opinion,
            angels do not exist. Angels were merely a misinterpretation of
            flesh-and-blood extraterrestrials who descended from the sky with
            means of technology. And that is what this quote-unquote,
            &ldquo;angels&rdquo; used.</em
          >&rdquo; - Giorgio Tsoukalos.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s the same argument over and over, but he is not expanding on
          it. Could it have been unicorns or leprechauns? Well, no, because we
          understand the sites nicely, you must ignore a lot of history and
          research to get to Giorgio's preferred explanation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&rsquo;re familiar with these churches, you are probably waiting
          for the Ark of the Covenant. It does appear on the show, but we won't
          discuss this in detail here. The short story is about an Ethiopian
          king named Menelik who stole the ark while visiting his father Solomon
          in Jerusalem. Menelik returned home with the ark and hid it in one of
          the churches in Aksum. We will return to this story later, but if you
          want to read more right now, I recommend Brian Dunning's cover over at
          Skeptoid. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Raiding the Ark of the
          Covenant.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <h3 id="baalbek">Baalbek</h3>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s ride again; this time, we will travel almost back to where
          we started. We&rsquo;re in Lebanon and the historical site of
          Baalbek.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This city is some 90 kilometers east of Beirut, and people have lived
          here for over 8000 years. The Romans and Greeks called this location
          &ldquo;Heliopolis&rdquo; or Suncity. But the site held little
          importance for some time; if it did, it seems to have been lost to
          time.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was not until the conquest of Alexander the Great and later the
          Romans that the site started to substantially develop into the ruins
          we see today. Now we&rsquo;ll tune in to what the Ancient Alien crowd
          says about the site.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >We don&rsquo;t know why Baalbek was chosen as this specific sight,
            may well be some kind of special power place. But what was
            originally there, before the Roman temple was this spaceport
            platform that was apparently used for extraterrestrials coming and
            going on Planet Earth</em
          >.&rdquo; - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >This is the real mystery of Baalbek &ndash; how these stones came
            to be there, why they were placed there, and specifically how they
            were transported into place, because some of the stones are of such
            magnitude that modern machinery is incapable of putting them there.
            But somehow our ancestors were able to do this.</em
          >&rdquo; - Philipp Coppens
        </p>
        <p>
          The main focus of their attention is three stones that the show claim
          weigh 800 to 1200 metric tons. These are part of a retainer wall of
          the Temple of Jupiter, and don&rsquo;t you think they do a decent job
          of portraying it as if the Romans are building on top of an older
          structure?
        </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to address here is that these three stones, usually
          referred to as the Trilithons, weigh 800 tons. Don&rsquo;t get me
          wrong, that is a lot of weight, but we do not need to exaggerate here.
          But three other stones on the site do weigh more. The fun thing about
          these is that they have been abandoned. Either at the quarry or not
          far away from it for the reason that they are cumbersome. Coppens's
          claim that we would not be able to move these types of things with
          modern machinery is strange. But it&rsquo;s not a rare argument;
          recently, I stumbled upon one who asserted this and used a video of an
          excavator as an example. The excavator is struggling to put a big
          bolder on a truck, but that is just the wrong tool for the job type of
          citation. The excavator also succeeded with the task. But remember
          that we move things like the gas platform Troll 2, which weighs 1.2
          million tons.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why can&rsquo;t the Temple of Jupiter not have been built by other
          cultures in the area? As I mentioned, it was not an important site for
          a long time. There&rsquo;s no evidence that Baalbek was on any tribute
          lists or involved in wars. Neither the Assyrians, Babylonians, nor
          Persians make mention of the site. A Roman geographer surveying the
          area after the Roman occupation notes that the area has some farms and
          many robbers. Not the powerhouse that would be able to move the
          stones. The Romans, on the other hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Romans had some excellent engineers. Remember that they did move
          Obelixes out of Egypt and built some impressive structures. The temple
          is also dedicated to a Roman god with a typical Roman layout and
          traditional columns you&rsquo;ve seen before. These columns are not
          built out of single megaliths, but multiple cylinders usually called
          drums. This will be important in a moment. If you were to google the
          retainer wall, you would note that these giant stones are not in the
          bottom row. It&rsquo;s on the second row. Excavations have been
          performed tunneling beneath the bottom stones and guess what we found.
          A discarded drum with a carving that can be traced to the reign of
          Emperor Nero.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, we can safely say that the most likely constructors
          were the Romans. But why was it built? As a retainer wall, if you go
          to the area, you&rsquo;ll quickly learn that soil erosion is a real
          and common threat. Even then, the people living in Baalbek struggled
          with this, and the Romans would not like their nice big temple to
          disappear in a mudslide. Therefore you build a retainer wall to keep
          the soil in place. The bigger stones you use, the more likely the
          chances of the structure surviving are.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how did they move them? We&rsquo;re not 100 percent sure, to be
          honest. There are multiple theories out there, some likelier than
          others. Remember that cranes, levies, pulleys, and other engineering
          tools had developed at this time. But we don&rsquo;t need these to get
          the Trillaton stones on top of the foundation. Looking at the
          abandoned stones, they point up a bit, probably indicating that they
          used rollers. So if you dig up a lot of earth around the foundation
          stones, you can practically drag the gigantic stones on top. Rollers
          do reduce friction by a lot.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          You might ask, would they not need 1000s of people for this? To that,
          I say Thunder Stone! The stone is part of a monument in S:t
          Petersburg, Russia. It weighs 1200 tons, and they dragged the stone 6
          km in 1770. This project used 400 people, and the journey took nine
          months.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But do the Alien Theorists have some last card up their sleeve? Yes,
          eyewitnesses who wrote it down!
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >What&rsquo;s really interesting about Baalbek it&rsquo;s that has
            always been known as the landing place. There&rsquo;s an actual text
            from Sumerian times called the Epic of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh actually
            claims to have seen rockets descend and ascend from Baalbek, the
            landing place.</em
          >&rdquo; - Jason Martell&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This idea is, in many cases, attributed to Zacharia Sitchin, except
          it&rsquo;s not his original idea. Baalbek is associated with aliens
          due to the works of Matest Agrest, a Sovjet mathematician. In 1959 he
          invented some of the claims associated with Ancient Aliens, for
          example, Sodom and Gomorrah, that we have looked into previously. Even
          if UFOs, sci-fi, and aliens could be behind mystic gods spread in the
          west, it was based upon Theosophy. This didn&rsquo;t work in strictly
          Atheistic Sovjet Union. Agrest attempted to rewrite these ideas to fit
          in Sovjet and replace myths and religion that used to explain things
          in the past. Instead of angels destroying a city, it was a nuclear
          device from aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it was due to his doctorate, but the ideas took hold and ended
          up in the hands of Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels. These two put
          these ideas into their book &ldquo;<em>Morning of the Magicians,</em
          >&rdquo; and Zacharia took his ideas from there.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if you go and read the Epic of Gilgamesh, you will have a hard
          time finding the passage Jason references. That&rsquo;s because if you
          read the passage, you don&rsquo;t get the feeling of rockets. Go to
          tablet IV and skip to when Gilgamesh wakes up from a dream.
        </p>
        <p><em>&ldquo;Did you not touch me? Why am I so disturbed?</em></p>
        <p><em>Did a god pass by? Why are my muscles trembling?</em></p>
        <p><em>Enkidu, my friend, I have had a third dream,</em></p>
        <p><em>and the dream I had was deeply disturbing.</em></p>
        <p><em>,, The heavens roared and the earth rumbled;</em></p>
        <p><em>(then) it became deathly still, and darkness loomed.</em></p>
        <p><em>A bolt of lightning cracked and a fire broke out,</em></p>
        <p>
          <em>and where(?) it kept thickening, there rained death.&rdquo;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowhere is there a name of a town or city. As for the name
          translation, since it&rsquo;s Sitchin&rsquo;s translation, you might
          suspect it&rsquo;s a little off. Baalbek does not translate to the
          landing place, no matter how you twist and turn it. But Lord of the
          Beka does work just fine.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, is there any room for aliens to be involved in
          these sites? No, not really. As we have seen, the archeological,
          historical, and most other records are more than well written for us
          not to need any aliens. People have been able to do incredible things
          for millennia. Even if we don&rsquo;t know a few things, we know
          enough to rule out aliens or gods for that part. We should give our
          ancestors the credit they deserve when they have built magnific
          things. The ancient alien argument boils down to an &ldquo;I think it
          kinda looks like a landingpad therefor it is&rdquo; type of
          idea.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Next time we will spend almost all our time in the Americas and look
          into a few rather strange claims. Could it be that the USA's founding
          fathers did hide something from us? Could it be that the revolution
          and democracy were not resting on greek philosophy but on alien
          intervention?
        </p>
        <p>
          But till then, remember to leave a positive review anywhere you can,
