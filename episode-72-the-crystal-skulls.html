        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine alternative history and ancient alien narratives in popular
          media. Do these ideas hold water to an archeologist, or are there
          better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 72, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we will look at the mysterious
          crystal skulls, which, yes, are those crystal skulls. Are they
          connected to the Mayans, and do they have magical powers? Well, a
          better question is to see if they are authentic. Join me as we will
          explore this topic together.
        </p>

        <p>
          I want to thank all of you who support the show, like Therese. You are

        <h2 id="crystal-skulls">The Mystery of the Crystal Skulls</h2>
        <p>
          So the crystal skulls. I think most people have actually heard about
          these at one point or another. They are even featured in that Indiana
          Jones movie we don't like to talk about. But if you aren't familiar
          with these objects, the story Ancient Aliens and others usually
          present is that these are powerful crystal objects. According to these
          modern legends, there are supposed to be 13 skulls in the world; only
          12 have been found so far. But if these 13 crystal skulls were brought
          together, something magical or powerful would happen. The effect would
          differ depending on who is telling you the story. Some will say it can
          control nature, while others claim it will unlock stored information
          within the skulls.
        </p>

        <p>
          As you might suspect, this is just pure fiction. These skulls are
          modern inventions that can be traced back to Mitchell-Hedges. I will
          circle back to this a bit later here. Something worth acknowledging,
          and something that Ancient Aliens even mentions, is that there are
          thousands of crystal skulls out there, all of them created in our
          modern time. Philip Coppens even seems to have a moment of sober
          reflection in the show:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "The crystal skulls have become so famous that the field has been
          flooded with dozens of modern skulls, and on a number of occasions,
          people who have possessed these skulls are trying to pretend as if
          their skull is ancient. And this, of course, is very difficult
          because, at the same time, we have the skeptics, the scientists, who
          basically say it is all fake. And so, as a result of which, we're
          really confronted with a mixture of crystal skulls and a very
          difficult situation."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          So, while the Ancient Alien people seem prepared to admit that there
          are fakes, they still claim that at least 12 are real. And if you are
          happy with fakes, there are sites that sell you kits with all 13
          skulls. But what skulls are classified as authentic? Well again, they
          are not too specific due to the chance of being disproven, I believe.
          At least the Mitchell-Hedges is still viewed as genuine by the
          believers, even as we will see in a bit that this seems to not be the
          case.
        </p>

        <h2 id="mitchell-hedges-skull">The Mitchell-Hedges Skull</h2>
        <p>
          So what is this Mitchell-Hedges skull, sometimes called the "The Skull
          of Doom," and where did it come from? If we listen to the Alien
          narrative, we often get a story that goes something like this:
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1924, the British adventurer and pulp writer Frederick Albert
          Mitchell-Hedges and his adopted daughter Anna were exploring and
          excavating a site called Lubaantun in Belize. Anna supposedly found
          this skull in the rubble of a collapsed altar in one of the temples.
        </p>

        <p>
          The issue with this story is that Mitchell-Hedges does not mention
          this in any of his notes from the expedition, nor do any others
          present at Lubaantun at the time. The first time Mitchell-Hedges
          mentions it is in a letter to his brother, stating that he bought it
          at an auction in 1943. This corresponds well with the earliest
          publication mentioning the skull, a 1936 article in the anthropology
          journal "Man." In this article, we can read that the skull is in the
          possession of a guy called Sydney Burney, a London-based art dealer.
          The same art dealer that would, in 1943, sell the skull at an auction
          to Mitchell-Hedges. Sydney Burney got his hands on the skull, not from
          some explorer returning from a Maya temple but from a French collector
          named Eugene Boban.
        </p>

        <p>
          Boban sold at least two confirmed skulls, according to an archivist at
          the Smithsonian named Jane Walsh. You might ask, Fredrik, could it not
          be that this Boban fella got it from an expedition in the Guatemalan
          Jungles? While it's plausible, the evidence seems to point to the fact
          that these skulls originated in Germany. Specifically, the town of
          Idar-Oberstein is renowned for its gemstone refinery. Unfortunately,
          we don't have hard evidence that Burney got the skull from Boban. It's
          not like we have a receipt or letters detailing the trade, but there's
          enough evidence to make a good case for it.
        </p>

        <p>
          F.A. Mitchell-Hedges didn't talk much about the crystal skull during
          his life. He mentions it in a paragraph in the first edition of his
          1954 biography, "Danger My Ally." In this first edition, he writes
          that "it is at least 3,600 years old and according to legend it was
          used by the High Priest of the Maya when he was performing esoteric
          rites. It is said that when he willed death with the help of the
          skull, death invariably followed." The section is, however, removed in
          later editions. Most of the stories we hear today are told by the
          daughter Anna. She is definitely the one who made the skull famous and
          brought it to a larger audience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="scientific-analysis">Scientific Analysis of the Skulls</h2>
        <p>
          Is this really what the studies have revealed? First of all, Anna
          Mitchell-Hedges never let the skull be scientifically tested during
          her lifetime. Frank Dorland was a freelance art restorer who made
          numerous claims about the skull, but we should note that he did no
          scientific testing with modern equipment. He did, however, mention
          mechanical grinding on the teeth of the skull, possibly by diamonds.
          It was also suggested that the skull was made of a composite of
          quartz. Based on his observations, Dorland indicated that the skull
          was likely 10,000 years old. During Dorland's caretaking of the skull,
          it caught the attention of writer Richard Garvin, who managed
          Hewlett-Packard's advertising account. Garvin organized tests at HP's
          crystal labs in Santa Clara. The labs discovered that, contrary to
          Dorland's belief, the skull and its detachable jaw was carved from a
          single piece of quartz crystal. Notably, HP did not investigate how it
          was made or determine its age.
        </p>

        <p>
          Mayan Archaeologist Norman Hammond, who had an opportunity to examine
          it, also reported that some holes seemed to have been made by metallic
          drills. But this was the extent of the examination during Anna
          Mitchell-Hedges's lifetime. When she died in 2007, the skull went to
          her husband, Bill Homann, who, for the first time, let the skull be
          examined with modern equipment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jane MacLaren Walsh, an anthropologist whose expertise is discovering
          fake pre-Colombian objects, performed the analysis. The tests were
          performed at the Smithsonian Institute. During this, several different
          tests and equipment were used, and in 2008 an SEM analysis was made.
          This would demonstrate that, as Walsh put it, "It seems reasonable to
          conclude from the SEM images that the Mitchell-Hedges skull was carved
          in modern times with high-speed, diamond-coated rotary burring and
          cutting tools of minute dimension."
        </p>

        <p>
          Analysis of other skulls has shown similar results. In the crystal
          skull found at the Smithsonian, Walsh found a deposit of silicon
          carbide, a modern abrasive not used until after 1930. Jane Walsh also
          compared these skulls with genuine artifacts made out of quartz from
          the correct time period. For example, a very nice-looking quartz
          goblet. The tool marks we find there are in line with the tools
          available to the people of the time and differ entirely from what we
          see in the crystal skulls. It might be good to mention that no
          archaeologist has since discovered a crystal skull. And all of those
          found in museums are later creations. I would suspect this would go
          for the other skulls in private collections.
        </p>

        <h2 id="plastic-shamanism">
          Plastic Shamanism and New Age Appropriation
        </h2>
        <p>
          Of course, the Ancient Alien people claim that an advanced
          civilization or aliens would have these tools. They also try to use
          historical or legendary sources. Let's hear what Chris Morton has to
          say:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "Several Native American tribes have similar stories about ancient
          crystal skulls that were said to have been left behind by the earliest
          ancestors way back in the mists of time. Some believe that these are
          ancient artifacts left behind by extraterrestrials or that they were
          remnants left over from the lost civilizations."
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          So we have yet again a claim that Native Americans, or as we have
          learned in previous episodes, any indigenous people, have legends
          clearly fitting what we see on the screen. A huge issue here for
          Morton is that, well, this is just not true. This is an invention by
          the Ancient Astronaut theorists. And while some Native Americans might
          have incorporated these ideas today, they were not present before
          these claims were invented by later authors.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have discussed the use of plastic shamanism in the past. The
          appropriation of Native American spirituality, especially by New Age
          groups, has a long and problematic history. Rayna Green's article,
          "The Tribe Called Wannabee," highlights how Euro-Americans have often
          romanticized and mimicked Indigenous cultures. This trend dates back
          to the 1800s with Wild West and medicine shows. This fascination
          evolved over time, with non-Native groups adopting Indigenous
          spiritual symbols and practices.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the rise of so-called "plastic shamans" didn't gain momentum
          until the New Age movement of the 1970s. These self-proclaimed
          spiritual leaders often fabricate stories about being taught by Native
          American elders despite lacking genuine connections to those cultures.
          A prominent example is Lynn Andrews, who claims mentorship from
          fictional Cree medicine women, reflecting a typical pattern in such
          narratives.
        </p>

        <p>
          The New Age movement differs from traditional religions in lacking
          formal doctrines, membership, or structure. It mainly attracts white,
          middle-aged participants who pay for books, classes, and
          workshops—often led by other white individuals posing as shamans.
          These portrayals rely on stereotypes and cherry-picked elements of
          Indigenous traditions, distorting their true meaning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Claims of Native American legends like the crystal skulls, for
          example, are inventions with no basis in authentic Indigenous
          histories. These myths emerged in modern New Age literature rather
          than pre-existing Native American traditions. The ongoing
          misrepresentation of Native cultures, even in popular media,
          perpetuates a cycle of exploitation and misunderstanding that
          undermines the depth and diversity of Indigenous spirituality.

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, the show is trying to claim that crystals have magical
          powers. In this, they invoke the legendary Druids; Jonathan Young
          says:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          "The druids used crystal to tell fortunes, to read the future, to do
          ecstatic mystical rituals. The Scot Highlanders called these "stones
          of power.""
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Again, this is based on pure fiction and fantasy. This seems not to
          have been the case, and the experts I've contacted have not heard that
          this would be a thing. But it sounds good, and it creates a historical
          narrative that sounds believable but is, in the end, nothing more than
          fiction. But this shows how the proponents of these ideas are not
          beyond making up arguments and evidence. Everything to sell their
          books and ideas while criticizing experts for not taking them
          seriously.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, to sum up, all the skulls we have found and examined are modern
          creations. Many are great works of art and should be displayed in that
          capacity. When it comes to the claims about their origin and potential
          powers, these are just made up. Every time someone investigates them
          from a scientific and neutral perspective, things are shown to be far
          from the fanciful stories told. While it's material for great fiction,
          these are not evidence of alien interference or lost technology.

          Sandra Marteleur created the intro music, and our outro is by the band
          called Trallskruv, who sings their song "tin foil hat." Links to both
