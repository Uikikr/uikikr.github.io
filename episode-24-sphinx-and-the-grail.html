          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between on the TV show Ancient Aliens.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This time we will solve the riddles of the Sphinx, could there be an
          ancient library beneath this famous monument? Some believe that the
          "Hall of Records" is real and is evidence of a much older sphinx. But
          how have Egyptologists dated this monument, and how would we know if
          it's correct? By using the latest research and technologies, we hope
          to decode this ancient mystery.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll also hunt for the Holy Grail and Visigoth treasure in
          Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau and Rosslyn Chapel. Did a french priest
          stumble upon portals and riches from another dimension? Did the
          templars find the Holy Grail and hide it with the help of William
          Sinclair in Scotland?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode is based on the claims in Ancient Aliens episode four of
          season three called "Aliens and Temples of Gold" (S03E04).

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 24. We will continue
          looking into claims from episode four of season three called "<em
            >Aliens and Temples of Gold</em
          >" (S03E04). You do not need to have heard the first part, but I
          recommend listening if you haven't. But this time, we will investigate
          the Sphinx, one of the world's most famous monuments. Some assert that
          it holds a secret more ancient than the pyramids themself. We will
          also hunt for the holy grail and treasure in France and Scotland,
          visiting Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau and Rosslyn Chapel outside Edinburgh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now when we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sphinx">The Sphinx</h3>
        <p>
          Even if we're leaving the pyramid we don't go so far. Let's hop on
          over to Khafre's pyramid complex just to the side of his father Khufu.
          Let's hear the show out again this time around and then go over the
          claims we hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show takes us back to 1936 and tells us that engineers finally
          revealed the sand-covered statue for the first time in centuries. They
          claim that this process took 11 years to do and we learn that those
          elitist egyptologists believe the Sphinx to have been made on Kafre's
          order around 2500 BCE. But could that be the whole truth? Robert
          Bauval thinks there's more to this story than we have been told.

          "The orthodox date about 2500 BC tagged on these monuments, has been
          challenged by a group of researchers including myself, who have argued
          that the erosion in the Sphinx suggests much, much older Sphinx."
        </p>
        <p>
          We learn that Egyptologists to this day argue about when and how it
          was built. So if science is not able to agree, could there really be
          something to Bauval's claims? Could this be evidence of
          extraterrestrial visitation?
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Jason Martell, it's most likely and he brings up examples
          of animal-headed creatures in Babylonian and Sumerian literature. On
          the screen, we do see examples of this but the animal-headed
          creatures, that Martell seems to think are Sumerian, are winged genies
          from the Akkadian empire. Sure, it is in the same area but not the
          same culture.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But with these animal-headed creatures, we're back with Zacharia
          Sitchin's writings and they discuss animal hybrids. That the alien
          gold mining race experimented with human-animal hybrids trying to get
          a race that would be able to work the mines more efficiently.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show then hypothesizes that maybe the Spinx was not intended as
          just a statue, maybe it was also meant to be some sort of vault to
          store all the gold. There are supposedly a lot of tunnels and caves
          beneath the plateau and the show brings up Ground Penetrating Radar
          has been done on the plateau and revealing caves and tunnels beneath.
          Robert Bauval tells us this:
        </p>
        <p>
          "A shaft was discovered, called the Osirian Shaft, which led under the
          Giza Plateau behind the Sphinx. Now, in that shaft, there are various
          passageways, that lead seemingly nowhere."
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >From a scientific point of view, a lot here about speculation and
            theories, and legends and so forth, there was a very first time that
            there&rsquo;s some strong indication that there might be these
            hidden tunnels and chambers under the Sphinx. And according to this,
            they found very strong evidence of what looks like artificial
            chambers.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <h3 id="hallofrecords">Hall of Records</h3>
        <p>
          According to the show, unspecified ancient texts claim it to be an
          elaborate depository beneath the Sphinx paw, known only as the hall of
          records. This is traced back to the destruction of Atlantis, where a
          few survivors emigrated to Egypt and set up their secret library to
          avoid losing all their records of technology. This event is thought to
          have taken place some 12 000 years ago. Erich Von D&auml;niken and
          Robert Bauval explain&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Hall of Record was made by us but with the tools, the knowledge
          of extraterrestrials."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is speculated that a group of survivors of Atlantis, came to Egypt
          at about 10,500 BC brought along with their records, their knowledge
          and built this storeroom somewhere at Giza."
        </p>
        <p>
          After more speculation on what might be down in the Hall of Records,
          we'll say farewell to Egypt this time.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="datingsphinx">The actual age of the Sphinx</h3>
        <p>
          Except for us dear listeners, let's sort all of this out. It was quite
          a short section that could have been much longer or maybe more
          detailed. They are missing one "expert" and that I find surprising,
          but we will get to that in a moment.&nbsp;

        <p>
          Let's rewind to the excavation of the Sphinx, now it is true that the
          impressive monument has been covered by sand, as the show says several
          times. But it was not uncovered in 1939 but a couple of years earlier,
          but what they did complete was the restoration of the Sphinx. Today
          it's thought of as quite destructive for the monument, but the
          sandstone is of relatively poor quality and was falling apart. But
          they restored it with concrete, adding a collar around the neck to
          stabilize it more and fixing the headdress. The erosion has, over the
          centuries, not been kind to the poor Sphinx. Not only has it lost its
          nose, no, Napoleon did not shoot it off with a canon, but it has also
          lost its beard.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The age of the Sphinx, is not much of an argument among scholars
          today. But it was a different story back in the 1800s. But, I don't
          think we should use the oldest theories when newer and better research
          is available. They do not spend much time on the age of the Sphinx for
          some reason; they just proclaim it to be 12 000 years old without
          going into details. Bauval is one of the authors who believe that they
          have evidence for this age, but even then there is little evidence to
          support this. This is with the help of Robert Schoch, a geologist who
          usually appears on the show but in this episode is strangely missing.

          Their idea why the Sphinx is much older than what we have dated it to
          is due to erosion that's on the back wall. The erosion is confirmed
          and it is even worse on the back wall, but as I mentioned, this whole
          section is in bad shape. Geologists blame this on a combination of
          wind and sand. It&rsquo;s also been noted that overnight condensation
          happens on the Sphinx, leading to capillary action. When the water
          evaporates in the morning, crystals are formed and flake the stone
          when expanding.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But Robert Schoch believe that this erosion could only happen if this
          section was heavily rained on and therefore needed to have been made
          in the Neolithic Subpluvial. This rainy era began about 14 000 BCE and
          ended about 5500 BCE. Now, we should note that the Giza plateau is
          uphill, and even if the Sphinx isn't placed on the top, it's pretty
          far up; it would not be an area where water was flowing, even if it
          were wetter. To make things worse for Schoch's theory, it was still
          quite humid during the rain of Khafre; we see this in archeological
          records and in depictions of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schoch did claim that it's possible that maybe Kafre reshaped the head
          during his time and he has tried to defend his thesis with little
          success. He has tried to change his theory as criticism has been
          raised. Much of this comes from "KMT: a modern journal of Ancient
          Egypt" where Scotch published his article in the summer issue in 1992.
          But his arguments and rebuttals have been thoroughly met by other
          scholars since.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how do we know the age of the Sphinx? Professor Salim Hassan did a
          lot of work outlining when the Sphinx could have been made. For
          example, we know that it can't be later than the 4th dynasty since the
          tombs on the south walls are of that date and could only have been
          made after the enclosure was created. If we turn our eyes toward the
          southwest corner we note a causeway and a trench must have been there
          before the enclosure was created. This leaves us with a narrow window
          on when the Sphinx could have been carved. Add to this archeological
          evidence beneath the stones of the enclosure suggest the reign of
          Khafre. So you would need to ignore much of the body of knowledge we
          have for Scotch theory to work.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          While science has moved forward regarding both the quality of the
          limestone, its fissures, and other things, Schoch, Bauval, and Hancock
          are all standing there, crossing their arms and trying to ignore the
          work that's been done. There's also been luminescence dating of
          the&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Sphinx that confirms the dating proposed by Egyptologists.</p>
        <p>
          I think it might be good to note that Robert Schoch is building his
          theories on Edgar Cayce and in part may be a bit on Madam Blatski. The
          latter is the founder of Theosophy and the former was known as the
          "Sleeping Prophet." Cayce was not described as a man of words, and he
          was next to illiterate. However, he still garnered a large crowd
          around him due to the belief that he had powers of healing and of
          prediction. Cayce was also believed to be able to see past lives in
          his dreams, in one of them he described the destruction of Atlantis
          and the Atlantean's construction of both the Sphinx and the Great
          Pyramid. He prophesizes that the Hall of Records will open in 1998,
          leading to a new age of wonder. But if Cayce didn't mean the release
          of Britney Spears's "Oops I did it again", "Harry Potter and the
          chamber of secrets" or the &ldquo;Truman show&rdquo; I think the
          vaults never opened. Most likely since they were an imaginary
          invention by a proclaimed prophet who mostly slept. Or maybe these
          were examples of things in the vault?
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the underground chambers beneath the plateau, there are
          fissures and holes around them. Some are from graves. Take for
          example, Hetepheres I, mother of Khufu. Khufu moved her grave after a
          probable grave robbery into a grave dug into the bedrock. There are
          more of these, so the show is correct even if their conclusion these
          cavities are the Hall of Records is wrong. As for the tunnels in the
          Sphinx, Zahi Hawass, who opened two of them in 1970, described them as
          follows:
        </p>

        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;The first tunnel is located behind the head of the Sphinx,
            cut into the mother rock about six meters. The second tunnel is
            located in the tail of the Sphinx. We learned of itfrom Sheikh
            Mohamed Abd al-Maugud, who in turn knew of it from his grandfather.
            It too is cut into the mother rock, about twelve meters. We found no
            significant artifacts inside the tunnel, but the evidence suggests
            that the tunnels were cut during the pharaonic period, I believe
            during the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. A third tunnel, on the north side
            of the Sphinx, has not been opened since 1926, when Emile Baraize
            opened it. We have photographs showing two workmen inside it.
            &ldquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, I think we have a good understanding of how we know the age
          of the Sphinx and why there's no Hall of Records. So let's head to our
          following location.

          From Egypt, we go to France. The village of Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau,
          France. January 29, 1953. Marie D&eacute;narnaud, a frail 85-year-old
          woman, lies on her deathbed. Apparently, she was supposed to give the
          secret location of a treasure but a stroke left her incapable of

          We learn that his treasure comes from the sacking of Rome by the
          Visigoths. They were returning from their plunder with wealth beyond
          anyone's imagination. So they stored it here, but it was left behind
          when they left the region 200 years later.

          We're getting some confusion here when we meet B&eacute;renger
          Sauni&egrave;re, a local priest of Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau. The
          confusion lies in the fact that the show does not tell you Marie is
          the housekeeper of Sauniere. The story is that when renovating the
          church he came upon the riches hidden by the Visigoth. We then talk
          about treasure hunting in the region due to the rumors. Phillip
          Coppens indicates that some have found parts of it but say no
          more.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show claims that Father Sauni&egrave;re talked about encountering
          this treasure and that it was by chance. They describe the priest as
          erratic and claim that his mental state affected the decoration of the
          church. Could this be an indication that what the priest found was
          something more? Could the treasure be more than just gold?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"B&eacute;renger Sauni&egrave;re placed an inscription over the
            door that people have been talking about for 100 years. The
            inscription says "Terribilis est locus iste." It's mistakenly
            translated most often as "This place is terrible" but, in fact, the
            inscription comes from the Old Testament, from the Book of Genesis.
            Jacob has a dream about a ladder that connects Heaven to Earth,
            where humans could connect to the divine. So, when you look at the
            Old Testament translation, what it really says is 'This place is
            awesome.'"</em

          Due to this reference, it must be some sort of stargate, according to
          William Henry. Philipp Coppens says that the area is known for UFO
          activity; people forget the time and have met the devil. So something
          must be going on. But again, we don't go much deeper than this.
        </p>
        <h3>Want to be rich? Become a priest</h3>
        <p>
          So all of this sounds like a pretty fanciful story but did a priest
          just stumble upon a Visigoth treasure forgotten in
          Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau? Well, the Visigoths did sack Rome in 410 on
          their third attempt and, according to Roman sources, made away with
          wealth. But the idea that the Visigoth would go and pool all their
          stolen gold in a cave is a bit weird. It would have been more
          realistic if they kept their part of what they took, not storing it in
          some vault to forget when it's time to flee. Now, there are cases
          where hoards have been found, but they can usually be tied to a family
          and house. We have several of these treasure hordes on Gotland here in
          Sweden. There's some discussion on why people did not return and get
          them, but again, it's on a family level.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Visigoth graves, they did not have many grave goods in them.
          Some have jewelry but far from everyone has it; it&rsquo;s more so
          that these finds are pretty scarce compared to other cultures. If we
          humor the idea of the wealthy Visigoth, would they not have finer
          things for their eternal rest? But as with other things, we don't need
          a gothic treasure to explain how Sauni&egrave;re got all the money for
          the renovation.

        <p>
          It boils down to good old-fashioned fraud and swindlery.
          B&eacute;renger Sauni&egrave;re's sudden wealth did catch the eye of
          both the church and journalists at the time. He not only started a
          considerable renovation in a small village beyond its means, but he
          also bought several plots of land and built a renaissance-style villa.
          This house was complete with an Orangerie and a cage for monkeys. To
          avoid some suspicion, Sauni&egrave;re put the house in Marie
          D&eacute;narnaud&rsquo;s name.
        </p>
        <p>
          The catholic church did call Sauni&egrave;re to three separate
          ecclesiastical trials due to his work in Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau. It
          turned out that he did not find a Visigoth treasure but a more real
          treasure in people&rsquo;s gullibility and fear of death. So what
          Berenger did was to sell mass; this meant he would hold a mass in
          someone&rsquo;s name and save them time in hell or purgatory. At this
          time, the Catholic Church somewhat allowed this practice but with
          restrictions, but Sauni&egrave;re didn&rsquo;t care about these
          restrictions and sold more than three masses a day. His accounting
          books show some months where he would earn up to 7000 francs on these
          sales. This is a significant amount even today. I hardly believe that
          this was the whole sum taken into account, as he worked with his
          brother on some of these illicit mass sales. It might be good to
          mention that he had other ventures at the time, which was the money he
          had chosen to put into his accounting.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned, his building projects did catch the eye of several
          people and organizations. The church would be the organization that
          investigated B&eacute;renger Sauni&egrave;re the most. Think about
          that, the catholic church in early 1900 felt compelled to investigate
          this accusation. The church might have let many things slide, but this
          was too much. So much in fact that Sauni&egrave;re was in front of the
          ecclesiastical court not once but thrice. His charges were:
        </p>
        <p>Trafficking in Masses,</p>
        <p>Disobedience to the Bishop,</p>
        <p>
          Exaggerated and unjustified expenditure to which fees from Masses that
          have not been said seem to have been devoted.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his first trial in 1910, B&eacute;renger Sauni&egrave;re did not
          even show, and he was sentenced in absentia, and this would be more or
          less the same for the subsequent three trials. For the second trial,
          he provided what he claimed to be the total invoices for the church
          renovation and building of his villa. It would have cost him about 36
          250, but the court noted that he had gathered 193 150 francs in
          donations. Later in the summer, it seems as if Sauni&egrave;re changed
          his tune and claimed that the building of his Villa Bethania cost him
          90 000 francs and the church cost 40 000.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ecclesiastical court ordered him to pay back all the ill-gotten
          funds. He was sentenced to suspension, removed from the priesthood,
          and during the time of suspension, could not administer
          sacraments.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          For the last few years of B&eacute;renger Sauni&egrave;re's life, he
          continued to sell masses and tried to appeal to Rome with what money
          he raised. This seems not to have been working, and on 22 January
          1917, he died. Abb&eacute; Jean Rivi&egrave;re performed his last
          rites and lifted the suspension at the moment of death. His trusty
          housekeeper Marie D&eacute;narnaud ended up paying for a modest chest
          and funeral.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The first to start spreading rumors about Sauni&egrave;re's supposed
          treasure was restaurant owner No&euml;l Corbu in the late 1950s. Corbu
          claimed that the priest had found a map of Blanche of Castile's hidden
          treasure inside a pillar. It seems as if he did this to attract more
          attention to the town and his business. It's from No&euml;l Corbu that
          we get the story about Marie D&eacute;narnaud, who died in 1953;
          strangely, he didn't spread this until after she had passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blanche was a french queen in the first half of the 13th century in
          France. These stories influenced Pierre Plantard, who used them in his
          esoteric hoax Priory of Sion that, in turn, was picked up by
          G&eacute;rard de S&egrave;de in his book L'Or De Rennes. This book
          would inspire the book "Holy blood, holy grail" and ancient alien
          theorists. But even if they make their best attempt to shoehorn in
          some portals and UFOs towards the end. They never really succeed in
          getting a proper alien connection here.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole story was straightforward, and nobody thought there was a
          treasure until No&euml;l Corbu started to make this up. Other authors
          incorporated it into different tales until Dan Brown in the DaVinci
          code forever imprinted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In all of the retellings centering on the conspiracy, they've
          strangely left out the selling of masses. The money Sauni&egrave;re
          did collect and we know about more than cover the renovations, nothing
          more mysterious here than personal greed.

        <h3 id="rosslyn">Rosslyn Chapel</h3>
        <p>
          Close to Edinburgh, Scotland, sits a church on top of a hill. It's
          called Rosslyn Chapel, formerly known as Collegiate Chapel of St
          Matthew. The construction of the church started in 1456 on behalf of
          William Sinclair. According to the church's original plan, it was
          supposed to be a cruciform, basically shaped like a cross.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the show, the church is supposed to have secret chambers
          where templars hid their gold and riches from excavating the temple
          mounds. William Henry fills us in:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Rosslyn Chapel is one of the most fascinating possible recreations
            of Solomon's Temple. It literally is a Holy Grail temple, that was
            constructed by William Sinclair, and it is designed to be a
            repository of Holy Grail secrets. When it was created it had the
            most wonderful and fantastic symbolism perhaps anywhere in the
            world."</em
          >
          - William Henry
        </p>
        <p>
          We covered the idea that the Templars excavated the temple mound in
          episode 8 when we had Erik Palmgren join us. So, according to this
          theory, the templars settled in on the temple mound and started
          excavating. But there are some issues with this theory. The Templar or
          the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon did
          have their base on the Temple Mound, they even got the last part by
          being housed in one of the wings. Baldwin I used the temple as a
          palace, and so would the Templars, but the upkeep had been terrible.
          Baldwin preferred lavish food to renovations and left the temple in
          poor condition. So when the templars took over, they had much to do,
          prioritizing fixing the roof and walls. Eyewitnesses from the time
          described the renovations but did not mention any excavations or
          retiling of the floor. They would not keep the mound for too long
          since, 70 years after the order was housed there, Saladin would take
          the city.

          The show goes on and wonders if there are mysterious messages and
          symbols hidden in the church. That is something that always strikes me
          as odd how every secret society supposedly leaves clues out everywhere
          and somehow maintains secrecy. Today's treasures are found because
          there are no leads to them; take the hoards on Gotland again, for
          example. If the owners had carved runestones with riddles, someone
          would sooner or later find it. I know it's fun to think that you might
          be able to stumble into a conspiracy and maybe save the earth. It's
          natural to want to be the hero in your own story, but we should look
          at this as a fallacy. Because when we think about it, a secret
          involving many people only works if most of them are dead.&nbsp;

          The show talks about William Sinclair and how brilliant he was, and
          this can be seen in how the church was designed. It contains elements
          from across the globe which is maybe fitting, since in episode 8
          William Sinclair went to Nova Scotia and built a giant vault in the
          treasure pit. But here he did instead stay and build this church to
          preserve the Templar's treasure, the order that by now had been gone
          for 200 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we then start to look up towards the ceiling, the show points out
          that there are 110 of these and they do have a purpose. Kathleen
          McGowan Coppens explains:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The Green Men appears in over 110 different locations. As you
            watch the progression of the Green Men from east to west, that
            progression represents the passing of time."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          These green men are, as the show explains, pagan gods. But that sounds
          a bit anachronistic since the pagan gods had long been gone from
          England. The name "Green men" originates in recent times; this term
          was coined in 1939 by Lady Raglan. She wrote this in an article in the
          paper "Folklore," which seems to be more of a whim than any scholarly
          reason. So the show's idea that this is a common word for fairy is a
          relatively late invention. These heads are more often known as foliate
          heads, originating from Roman tombs. So it's a known roman decorative
          feature that spread across France, Spain, and lastly, Britain. These
          elements became popular again during the Romanesque period and were
          typical church decorations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the idea that the faces turn older the further you go in the
          church, this seems to be a question of taste. I can't really see it in
          the photos available to me. There are not only men among these faces,
          there are examples of women too. The writers think that these faces
          somehow have to do with the grail, but the connection is relatively
          weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show seems to think they thoroughly established that this is the
          location of the holy grail, but where would it be in the church? So
          the place presented is a unique pillar called "The Apprentice Pillar."
          The show claims this pillar is notable because a man went into the
          church to try to cut it down. We're also told that it closely
          resembles a DNA strand, but how would the people of this time know
          what DNA looked like?
        </p>
        <p>
          So the pillar in question is real and goes under a few names but most
          commonly the "Apprentice Pillar." The name comes from a story where
          the master mason went to Rome with Sinclair's patron ship to study
          architecture. In the meantime, the apprentice had a dream and went and
          carved the pillar, so when the master mason came back and saw the
          amazing craftmanship he got so envious that he killed the apprentice.
          For the crime the master was hanged, this is according to somewhat two
          of the "Green men" represent. This is a fanciful story but it's likely
          not true, the reason the pillar is different is due to it was part of
          Sinclair's original cruciform plan. If they would have continued in
          that way it would have been at the head of Christ.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the helix, DNA has two strands. The pillar has three. Looking
          at the pillar we see some art that seems to fit into a more religious
          narrative. On the south side of the pillar, we have the sacrifice of
          Isaac. By the foot we see dragons entangled with what seems to be dead
          leaves. Maybe the pillar has to do with sacrifice and the sacrifice of
          Christ? For sure, it's not the final resting place of the fictional
          grail.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be good to mention that what we see today is reconstructions
          from 1862. The church was abandoned in 1592 after the altar was
          destroyed, so it was in poor condition when the queen of 1840 visited
          and wanted it restored. Would a secret cabal let a site they swore to
          protect just decay? If it were my secret order, I would not but who am
          I?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The show ends with this quote from Tsoukalos.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The whole story is very fascinating to the Ancient Astronaut
            Theory. Wolfram von Eschenbach, for example, suggests that the Holy
            Grail arrived from the stars. And the question is, what did he mean
            by that? It is often described as this vessel that had blinking red
            lights. Were the Templar in possession of some technological
            device?"</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, the author portrays the grail
          as a gemstone or stone with different colors. It's an idea that floats
          around that it's from the sky, but that could be the dove that comes
          down on Good Friday to give power to the stone. I could not find the
          exact passage where the stone would have fallen out of the sky. But
          it's clear from the descriptions it does not blink or behave like a
          machine. Again Georgio claims something that he hopes you won't be
          looking up later.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2>Outro</h2>
        <p>
          There we have it, the alien temples of gold. I felt this episode was
          relatively weak and they did their best to find some little tie
          towards aliens. Ultimately, it became unclear when we went on the
          grail hunt. The most fun for me was the El Dorado part, to be honest,
          and Paititi places I was somewhat aware of but never really looked
          into. As for evidence of alien interference, I give this episode a 1.
          It was exciting but it would have been better if they'd let the aliens
          go and just done the research.&nbsp;
