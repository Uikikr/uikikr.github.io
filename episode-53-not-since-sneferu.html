          This time, we are going to look at the top 10 pyramids of the world
          according to Ancient Aliens. I could not tell if the list is based on
          how significant evidence the pyramids are for extraterrestrial
          visitation or how cool they are. The episode would also become too
          long if we did the whole list simultaneously, so this will be a
          two-parter. You could also view it as a compilation episode of some
          great pyramids and one farm structure. We will spend most of our time
          in Mesoamerica and visit Peru and Greece. I think you'll really love
          this episode; we will even have a case where the Ancient Astronaut
          believers cite their sources, a real Christmas miracle here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and välkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the
          podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history and
          ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 53, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. We are continuing our examination of the top
          then pyramids of the world according to Ancient Aliens. This is based
          on episode 11 from season 19, so it's one of the brand-new episodes
          from the series. Last time, we looked at the bottom tier of the list,
          which included El Castillo, the Pyramids of Teotihuacan, the Sican
          Pyramids, El Mirador, and the supposed pyramid of Hellinikon.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this episode will continue breaking down this list, it is
          separate, so you can jump straight in without wondering what's
          happening. So what will we talk about then? Well, we will learn about
          the evolution of Egyptian pyramids and busting several myths
          surrounding their construction. This time, we will focus mainly on the
          Djoser Step pyramid, then throw Ancient Aliens number four to the
          side, instead talking about the pyramid builder Sneferu. You'll see
          why I made this decision later, but it is an Ancient Egypt
          special—building up our knowledge to tackle the great pyramids of Giza
          later.
        </p>

          get everything from? Well, check out the episode page to learn more

          A huge thanks to all the patrons who support this show. The Patreon
          bonus episode will drop here in mid-January and focus on "Chariots of
          the Gods" by Van Däniken. If you want to learn how to support the
          show, I'll tell you all about that later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3 id="djoser">Djosers Step Pyramid</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome back to Egypt, where we will look at number five on the list.
          The oldest pyramid on the list is the step pyramid in Saqqara. It was
          built for the third dynastic ruler, <em>Netjerikhet</em>, or as he is
          often referred to, <em>Djoser </em>or <em>Zoser</em>. Djoser is the
          name most associated with the pharao today and even in later Egyptian
          writing. But this seems to originate from a mistranslation of the old
          records. <em>Netjerikhet </em>is the Horus name, translating to divine
          of body, which people would have used for this pharao. The confusion
          seems to originate from a phrase associated with the Horus name,
          <em>Khenti-ta-djeser-nisut</em>, or in English, "<em
            >Blessed be the country of the sublime king</em
          >." In later texts from the 18th dynasty, we start to see the name
          <em>Djoser Netjerikhet</em>
          when referring to this king. Worth remembering is that the Egyptian
          culture lasted for 3000 years, if not more. Many changes would have
          happened to the language during this time, and I think it's not too
          strange that a mistranslation might have occurred when scribes
          translated texts that at that time might have been 1000 years old. To
          avoid confusion, and save you from my pronounsiation, I'll use the
          name Djoser when speaking about this pharao.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest, I would put this pyramid higher on the list, but the top
          five aren't too bad, I guess. What is alarming is the information we
          get from the Ancient Alien people and Ramy Romany, an Egyptologist
          unfortunately.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mainstream archaeologists suggest the pyramid was built as a tomb for
          King Djoser, but like all other Egyptian pyramids, there is no
          credible evidence that a body was ever entombed there."
        </p>
        <p>
          So, this is a statement that we often see among alternative historians
          when they speak about the Egyptian pyramids, and it is both true and
          false. It is untrue that we have never found any human remains in
          pyramids. Carbon dating has shown that at least two pharaohs seem to
          have been found in their pyramids. Strouhal and Vyhnánek et al. could
          demonstrate that the remains found in the fifth dynasty rule Neferefre
          Isi's pyramid correspond with Neferefre's death. Djedkare Isesi, also
          from the fifth dynasty, is another example of a ruler that seem to
          have been found in their pyramid confirmed by carbon dating by the
          same team.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should not forget the pyramid of King Unas of the fifth dynasty,
          constructed two hundred years after the Great Pyramid of Khufu. In
          addition to a few grave goods, being the first pyramid with the
          pyramid texts, Kung Una's name, we also found the remains of an
          individual in the sarcophagus. These are not carbon-dated yet, but due
          to the condition and other clues, they seem to be of the old kingdom
          and presumed to be Unas himself. Hopefully, tests will be allowed, and
          we can find out who this individual might be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regarding the pyramid of Djoser, human remains were found in the
          pyramid. Still, Strouhal et al. could show that this was a later
          burial and most likely not the remains of Djoser, unfortunately. But
          it's clear it was a tomb designed to be one from the beginning, as we
          will see in a moment. We also have texts from ancient visitors in the
          mortuary temple who talk about their visit to the grave. Firth and
          Quibell describe several of these comments in their book documenting
          the excavation of the complex. One scribe, Ahmoses from the 18th
          dynasty, wrote on the temple walls based on Nils Billing's
          translation, "I came to visit Djoser's temple and found it as if
          heaven was contained within it and the sun god rose within. He said:
          may pieces of ox, bird, and all good and pure things come to the Ka of
          Djoser, the righteous. May refreshing myrrh rain from heaven, may
          incense fall from above."
        </p>
        <p>
          Not all were, however, impressed with the graffiti, and here's an
          opposing view again based on Billing's translation. "My heart becomes
          ill when I see these hands work. Like the creation of thoughtless
          women. Could it not have been someone here to stop them before
          entering this temple? What I see is scandalous! These are no writers
          enlightened by Toth!"
        </p>
        <p>
          We can learn from the graffiti, both positive and those texts that are
          a bit more resentful, that the ancient Egyptians knew what this
          construction was. They knew this was the burial complex for the people
          of the 18th dynasty, ancient king Djoser. And this is a vast and
          intricate construction consisting of more things than just the
          pyramid. To better understand this site, we need to look back again at
          the history of burials in ancient Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, we see simple graves dug down in the desert. The issue with
          these graves is that they are not permanent. The Egyptians would
          quickly have learned that this method of burials is not a way to
          eternity. So they dug down a room, later putting a mound above this
          grave. The mound would later evolve into what we know as a mastaba,
          named after the Arabic word for bench. These larger square structures
          were reserved primarily for the royalty but also more and more later
          the elite. These mastabas were designed to be almost like a house for
          the diciest. As with houses today, these structures could become large
          and have several rooms and chambers containing everything the one who
          had gone west would need in the afterlife. In ancient Egypt, death was
          associated with the West, so if someone was dead, you could refer to
          them as a Westerner; saying that they had gone west was an idiom,
          meaning a person had died.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they grew, these royal mastabas became more complex and added
          funerary rites and architecture. For example, we start to see the
          mastabas being built with a perimeter wall and funerary enclosures for
          the pharao in separate locations. So there we have the evolution up
          until Djoser enters the scene. What Djoser and, most likely, Imhotep
          did was look at the previous buildings and realize that mudbricks are
          not eternal. They opened the stone and started building it in stone.
          At first, they just wanted an ordinary mastaba, which was the grave's
          first version. I like to picture Djoser looking at the mastaba taking
          form, saying to Imhotep, "<em
            >I mean, it's big. But how about we extend it a little on the sides
            so everyone see how great I am.</em
          >" So the mastaba was extended on the sides, but Djoser was back again
          with Imhotep. "<em
            >It's the bigger, but can't we extend it to cover the burials on the
            eastern side, then everyone will know how truly noble I am.</em
          >" So the mastaba was extended again, so we have three phases: M1, M2,
          and M3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, it's just my imagination, but Djoser stands there looking at
          the work, leaning over to Imhotep, who is starting to look slightly
          annoyed.
          <em>"It's wide, but it's not tall; what if nobody sees it?</em>" So,
          the construction changed again. This time to a four-story pyramid. Was
          Djoser happy with this? Since it changed to a six-story step pyramid
          instead, Djoser had one last suggestion for Imhotep. I can picture
          Djoser standing there going, "<em
            >It's big; could it be that it's too big?</em
          >" But note here that only the outside of the grave changed, not the
          inside, which still consisted of an underground burial complex like
          the mastabas before. Ultimately, it's also just mastabas on top of
          different mastabas, creating a large, simple structure that can
          support its weight due to the design.
        </p>
        <p>
          This burial also comes with other inventions, like incorporating the
          funerary complex with the burial complex. Djoser also added the site
          for his
          <em>Heb sed</em>
          festival so he could be rejuvenated in the afterlife. Heb Sed festival
          was celebrated on the king's 30th year on the throne to prove he was
          still fit to lead the country. It most likely originated from a time
          when the pharaoh was removed from power when he was too weak. We must
          remember that the king at this time was supposed to lead the army by
          himself and do everything needed in person. But by doing the Heb Seb
          festival, he could become young again. This ceremony included things
          like running, wrestling with young men, and other physical activities
          that, when completed, would give the king a new life.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this is among the first large-scale projects in stone, it can
          still give us an idea of how they had done things before. Because
          while the construction was in stone, it was worked to resemble the
          materials they usually used in the buildings previously. For example,
          pillars were carved to look like reed or other organic material to
          give the impression of not being of stone but as things had been done
          until then.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are even more innovations, such as a southern burial, that we
          will find in later constructions after this. We see one of the first
          human-size Ka statues in this complex depicting Djoser. Again, this is
          something we will discover later and show that this place was built
          for eternity; the pharaoh would not have a second death with all this
          in place. This statue is today located in the Egyptian Museum in
          Cairo, and it's a stern man who looks at us. I like the details in the
          statue and how they aimed for realism. You can even see that he seems
          to have had a thin mustache on the upper lip, giving the pharaoh a bit
          of character.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all of this, it's quite evident that the pyramid was intended and
          used as a funerary complex. We can add hundreds of jars found with
          inscriptions that Djoser preserved in a room to show his ties to
          earlier kings. Nils Billing and other Egyptologists believe these jars
          were used in previous pharaohs' heb sed festivals. With the expansion
          of the M3 mastaba, Djoser decided to take care of these artifacts.
          These jars strengthen the idea that this was an evolution of the
          mastaba constructions on a new and more prominent level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Djoser's successor, Sekhemkhet, also tried to build a step pyramid.
          With Imhotep as the vizier, we can see that this pyramid used the same
          method as Djoser. The difference is that Sekhemkhet died early and
          quickly, so only the first layer of the pyramid was completed. Based
          on the base's size, they likely attempted to create a larger
          construction than Djoser with seven layers. Sekhemkhet seemed to know
          what he wanted from the start and only ended up with a sort of mastaba
          due to the short reign. As with Djoser's step pyramid, this was
          constructed out of limestone, and each addition to the layers would
          lean 15 degrees inward. The burial chamber was underground, as was a
          costume, and would have had a mortuary complex similar to Djoser's.
          Even if this pyramid was never finished, we could still learn from it;
          for example, we can see how stones were roughly cut at the quarry and
          then dressed at the site.

        <h3 id="imhotep">Imhotep - architect and god</h3>
        <p>
          When it comes to the character of Imhotep, we get quite a lot of
          strange claims. One of the laziest is William Henry.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Imhotep rose to the incredible status as the vizier, or wizard, to
            the pharaoh. This is where we get that word wizard from, vizier.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          While it is correct that Imhotep was the vizier to Djoser, a role
          often given to someone in the extended family during this time, the
          word is a modern invention. In Ancient Egypt, the title was djat or
          tjati, a term we today translate to the Arabic phrase wazīr;
          translating to English, we would get minister or aide. The word
          <em>wazīr </em>literary translation is "<em>to share the burden</em>."
          It's not too far off to compare this position to a prime minister's.
          The role of the djat included control and responsibility over
          agriculture, finances, military, logistics, city planning, and
          religious affairs. The person having this title would undoubtedly have
          been one of the most influential persons in Egypt.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the word wizard originates from Middle English, and
          the earliest account we have of this word is from 1440, some 4100
          years after the first preserved use of the title by the second dynasty
          pharao Nynetjer. The Middle English words are also just formed by the
          phrase wise with the suffix -ard added to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >He showed up into the life of the king out of nowhere, and then
            ascended into position so quickly, which is very uncommon in ancient

        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >What does that mean? What do you mean "out of nowhere"? Did he drop

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>( laughs )&nbsp;</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >In Egyptian history, you can normally trace every position back to
            their parents. But Imhotep, nothing.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          These are pretty strange comments from Ramy Romany, who is supposed to
          be an Egyptologist. As I mentioned, Imhotep became the vizier during
          the reign of Djoser and probably held this position during the reign
          of the following two pharaohs. We have very few contemporary accounts
          of Imhotep, limited to a few inscriptions of his names and titles. One
          can be found on the base of a statue that supposedly depicted pharao
          Djoser, which would have been considered a high honor. In this
          inscription, we learn that Imhotep was, among several titles, also the
          chief architect of the pharao, hence the idea that Imhotep was the
          creator of the stepped pyramid of Saqqara. Interestingly, we don't see
          a reference to Imhotep as a healer in these inscriptions, even though
          he would become one of the few who later got deified in ancient Egypt
          as a god of medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
          That we don't find contemporary accounts of people living during the
          early dynastic period is not too strange. We must remember that
          Imhotep lived 4100 years ago, and documents from this era are scarce.
          People didn't generally pen their memoirs to be mass-printed either;
          if lucky, we can find a biography on the tomb's walls. However,
          Imhotep's grave is not yet discovered; we will return to this shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are texts and statues of Imhotep that come down to us from later
          periods. We have texts and traditions about Imhotep that date to the
          Middle Kingdom. While Imhotep was most likely a commoner, it was not
          as unusual as the alternative historians like to portray this rise, or
          in this case, Ramy Romany. We have other examples of people outside
          the royal extended family taking this place, such as Kagemni I, who
          was the vizier to Sneferu. Kagemni is also supposed to have been a
          wise man who wrote the wisdom text "The Instruction Addressed to
          Kagemni and His Brethren." However, this text is only preserved from
          the Middle Kingdom. Then there are vezirs like Werbauba and Niankhba,
          commoners who did not inherit the title. Now, there are examples of
          when the title seems to have been inherited, such as Akhethetep, who
          was the son of Ptahhotpe I. Ptahhotpe appears to have been one of
          those wise sages and might have penned the wisdom text "The Maxims of
          Ptahhotep." This book contained advice to young men on how to behave
          appropriately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imhotep is not the only commoner to have been deified either; we have
          Amenhotep, Hapu's son, who was also bestowed this honor. I don't want
          to sound as if I downplay Imhotep's contributions; he must have been a
          smart cookie. But we need to look at his achievements and
          contributions in relation to the other viziers and officials during
          the early dynastic period and the Old Kingdom in general. By doing
          this, we can better understand the society and how things came to be
          later in history. Imhotep might be the original author of the medical
          text we know today as the Edwin Smith Papyrus. Due to the nature of
          the text, it can be argued that it was written during the pyramid
          constructions or other large-scale construction projects. Most of the
          text deals with injuries one might succumb to during construction,
          such as broken limbs and the like. The advice is also quite good and
          would have, in some cases, been helpful. It's also written
          surprisingly scientifically with a title and description of the
          injuries, how to examine the condition, and how and if treatment
          should be carried out. There are cases where the author says the
          condition is too severe to treat, and there's nothing the doctor can
          do.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ancient astronaut theorists are hopeful that, if the tomb of Imhotep
          is ever discovered, it might be found to contain the remains of an
          otherworldly visitor."
        </p>
        <p>
          Imhotep tomb has not yet been discovered, but there have been several
          attempts. Professor Walter Emery was one archaeologist who set out
          trying to find the tomb; Emery knew that Imhotep was allowed a tomb
          close to Djoser's pyramid in Saqqara and thought that he could use
          Imhotep's god status to find it. In later Egyptian history, as we
          mentioned before, Imhotep became a god; with this in mind, Emery
          thought that the tomb of Imhotep would be a logical pilgrim
          destination. Upon surveying the area, he noticed an abundance of
          prayers and thanks dedicated to Imhotep. Emery later came across a
          tomb where these prayers were plentiful. Inside, he would find droves
          of mummies of Ibis birds inside jars. The Ibis was a bird closely
          associated with the cult of Imhotep. Carefully, Emery excavated the
          tomb and then. Then Emery died, the excavation stopped, and nobody has
          picked it back up again. I'm not entirely sure why, but it would be of
          great interest to learn who the tomb belonged to. It might not have
          been related to Imhotep, just a tomb rumored to be the viziers and the
          pilgrims initially accepted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So again, we see how the pseudo-scientific crowd focuses on something
          that's not much of a mystery when we start to read about it while not
          giving much attention to the real mystery. Would it not be good
          television to hunt for the lost tomb of Imhotep, follow in the
          footsteps of Emery, and maybe contribute to our understanding of
          ancient Egypt? If I had the resources, The Hunt of Imhotep would be a
          documentary I'd like to make or watch if someone else did it. A real
          mystery that we can potentially solve. It's not a constructed enigma
          that is only mysterious if you have not picked up a history book.
        </p>
        <h3 id="sneferu">Not since Sneferu</h3>
        <p>
          So we are now on the number four of the top ten pyramids according to
          Ancient Aliens. In this spot, we find the "hidden pyramids of China."
          Something that was highly unimpressive since they are even worse than
          the Bosnian pyramids. The story boils down to a pilot flying over
          China claiming to have seen a pyramid once. Then, a second pilot
          claimed to have seen a jade pyramid somewhere else; the issue is that
          nobody else had seen these before or after, and this was in areas
          still inhabited. The locals seem not to have an oral or written
          tradition of pyramids vanishing or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          As there is insufficient evidence to validate the veracity of these
          stories, I suggest we utilize this moment to delve into the discussion
          of some pyramids that have been overlooked and were not included on
          the list. I'm talking about the pyramids of Sneferu. These buildings,
          especially the final red pyramid, deserve to be higher up on the list,
          but number four isn't terrible either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sneferu was quite the character and must have had quite the willpower.
          Because he would not build one pyramid, he made three during his
          lifetime. This pharaoh will also introduce the first true pyramid to
          the world. Sneferu was the founder of the fourth dynasty and inherited
          the throne from his father, Huni. The succession of the throne seems
          to have been smooth, so Sneferu could easily take control over a
          unified kingdom with a well-run and established state administration.
          While Sneferu's pyramids are what he might be most remembered for, he
          also waged successful wars in Nubia, bringing back wealth and glory
          for Egypt. He also extends the agricultural estates and husbandries
          internally throughout Egypt to increase the farm yield. This increase
          in food translated into a well-stocked treasury.
        </p>
        <p>
          As royalty was supposed to do, Sneferu started to plan for the eternal
          afterlife and decided to build his first tomb in Meidum. If you visit
          this site today, you will be met with a pretty strange monument; it
          does not look like a pyramid but rather a lonesome tower guarding the
          desert. Around it, we can see blocks and rubble lying around as if the
          outer layers had just fallen off. The locals have given it the
          not-so-proud nickname "el-Haram el-kaddab" or "The false pyramid."
        </p>
        <p>
          The poor state of the pyramid is most likely due to later vandalism
          and locals reusing the stone. During 1100 CE, Sheik Abu Mohammed
          Abdalla described the pyramid as having five steps. The three-level
          tower we see today was told by the Danish sea captain Frederik Norden,
          who visited the pyramid in 1737. Flinders Petrie noted that the locals
          were using the site as a quarry and that any Meidum villager of rank
          would use the stone as part of their tombs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, some Egyptologists like Nils Billing suggest that Huni,
          Sneferus's father, built the early stages of the pyramid. Others like
          Miroslav Bárta Mark Lehner suggest that Sneferu built the whole
          pyramid and as evidence, only Sneferus's name appears on the pyramid
          and that the ancient name for the site is "Djed Sneferu" or "Sneferu
          endures."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Meidum pyramid was originally planned to be a seven-step pyramid,
          but around step five, the plans were changed, and the pyramid was
          enlarged and intended to be nine steps. The pyramid's stones were
          inward-sloping, and combined with the slope, the design was intended
          to be an enormous step pyramid. The original step pyramid plan is not
          the only thing similar to Djoser's pyramid; we also find the enclosure
          and a southern burial at the site. An innovation was thought that the
          burial chamber was above ground and incorporated a corbel roof.
        </p>
        <p>
          A corbelled roof is an engineering method where the stones in the roof
          are extended slightly beyond the layer below, gradually converging
          towards the top. The corbelled roof creates a sort of inverted pyramid
          inside the chamber and helps with the weight distribution; it
          redirects the force of the weight above down and to the side, helping
          create a self-supporting structure, and is, as we see, very durable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But 15 years into Sneferus's reign, things changed. For some reason,
          he ordered the completed pyramid in Meidum to be abandoned. A new
          burial started to be constructed, this time in Dashur—a site about 40
          kilometers from Meidum. Here, we will see a new architectural idea
          take form. Instead of the stepped pyramid, Sneferu aimed for a true
          pyramid with straight sides. The original base was supposed to be
          about 150 meters, but the builders changed the angle of the slope. A
          stepped pyramid usually has a 72-78 degree angle. At the bent pyramid,
          we will learn why it got this name shortly; the angle was changed to
          58 degrees. This angle would prove to be one of the three significant
          issues with the pyramid. The second issue was that it was not built on
          a proper foundation; parts of the pyramid were on sand. If you make
          your pyramid on sand, you'll have a bad time, as Sneferus builders
          would learn. The third issue was that they still built as one would do
          a stepped pyramid with the stones leaning inward toward the center.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to excessive weight and pressure, the building has developed
          cracks in the burial chamber. If you were allowed to enter the
          chamber, you would be able to see how the builders attempted to
          reinforce it with massive cedar logs imported from Lebanon. Some
          changes were made to the construction; they extended the foundation by
          40 meters and tried to reduce the angle to 55 degrees. This landlord
          special didn't work, and it became clear that the pyramid was beyond
          saving. But instead of just abandoning it altogether, Sneferu
          completes this structure. But they drastically change the angle to 43
          degrees to save material, creating this noticeable bend.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now, Sneferu had been on the throne for 30 years; time was running
          out, and he didn't have the burial he wanted yet. But instead of
          giving up and returning to Meidum Sneferu, attempt one last time. In
          the new attempt, the angle is gentler, only 43 degrees. They seem to
          have learned a lot from constructing the bent pyramid, and we don't
          see the same experimentation and mixing of various innovative ideas as
          before. This pyramid appears more planned and properly executed. Since
          time was running out, things needed to go well, and they did. We get
          our first true pyramid at last. The graffiti on the stones also helps
          us date the construction to start in the 30th year of Sneferus's
          reign. The mortuary complex is smaller now; I assume that this part
          had to take a backseat in the project. An exciting thing, however, is
          that during the construction of the North, or the Red Pyramid as it's
          also called. Sneferu returns to Meidun and his abandoned step pyramid
          and starts to fill out the steps to create a true pyramid. The reason
          for this is unclear, but it could be that Sneferu decided to have his
          secondary burial as earlier kings and wanted a more unified design.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must have been quite the individual this Sneferu, but all this
          shows that it was humans who built the pyramids. We see how they
          experimented, made mistakes, and learned from these projects. You see
          how things evolve and how some things are becoming standard, such as a
          southern pyramid-like Djoser, and things that disappear, such as the
          Heb Seb enclosure. What we have examined here will be fundamental when
          speaking about Sneferus's son, Khufu, and the Great Pyramid of Giza.
          However, that will be something for next time when we discuss the last
          three pyramids on this top ten list.
