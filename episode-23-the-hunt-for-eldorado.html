          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between on the TV show Ancient Aliens. In this episode, we will set
          out deep into the jungles of South America, searching for two famous
          cities made of gold. Eldorado and Paititi, could these legendary
          places be evidence of alien visitation? Join in as we see what the
          latest research has uncovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll also look into modern attempts to turn ordinary metals into
          precious metals. New technologies have unlocked what some call "the
          philosopher's stone." But could this technology have existed in the
          past?
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode is based on the claims in Ancient Aliens episode four of
          season three called "Aliens and Temples of Gold" (S03E04). Our intro
          music is by

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine the TV show, Ancient Aliens. Do their
          claims hold water to an archeologist, or are there better explanations
          out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 23, as you might have
          guessed from the title. This will be a gold-heavy episode. We will
          break down episode four from season three, "<em
            >Aliens and Temples of Gold</em
          >" (S03E04). In this episode, we will go and look for Eldorado and
          scour the highlands of Peru for another golden city called Paititi.
          How did the ancient Egyptians obtain all their gold? Could it be that
          they had access to lost technologies that we're just now beginning to
          unlock?
        </p>

          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now when we have finished our preparations, let&rsquo;s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3 id="eldorado">El Dorado</h3>
        <p>
          Where to start an episode about gold, if not with the quest for El
          Dorado? I have to hand it to them; this time, they have a clear thread
          and will somewhat stick to it. The show takes us to the highlands of
          Colombia, and Lake Guatavita, which the narrator claims was formed by
          the impact of a meteorite. Could this lake be the origin of the
          mystery that is El Dorado? And they explain the myth as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Since the 16th century, El Dorado has been the &ldquo;holy
            grail&rdquo; for fortune hunters. Legends abound about a place full
            of untold riches somewhere in South America. Yet, to this day, the
            mythical city remains undiscovered. But if such a magnificent place
            does exist, how has it eluded explorers for centuries?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not entirely sure why they add the ranking on the civilization
          there, but alright. Let's continue with the show's explanation before
          pulling out pushpins and yarn. They do a decent job describing the
          Spanish chronicler's take on the story. It's told to us that the ruler
          of the Muiscas was known as Zipa, and I'm going to pause here quickly.
          The idea of one ruler, one tribe/civilization/empire is a somewhat
          eurocentric thought. In reality, the Muiscas were a confederation of
          several tribes with a shared culture. Even if independent chiefdoms
          formed it, the tribes would unite against a common threat. This
          confederation was headed by a northern, for lack of a better word,
          ruler called Hoa. The south was governed by Zipa, so they are
          technically correct, but it's a more complex story than
          presented.&nbsp;

          The show explains that the conquistadores called this ruler the Golden
          One or El Hombre Dorado due to a special ceremony in which the leader
          participated. According to the show, the leader would go out on a raft
          in the lake and sacrifice large amounts of gold to the gods residing
          in Lake Guatevita. Over time the name changed and became shorter until
          it finally became the location of El Dorado. We also learn that in
          1912 the lake was excavated by the engineer Hartley Knowles who
          recovered $20 000 worth of treasure. But this is only a tiny sliver of
          what people believe was hidden by the tribe beneath the lake.
        </p>
        <p>
          So how does the show do compared to the genuine history of El Dorado?
          They didn't spend so much time on this location, and maybe it's
          because the more you look, the more El Dorado turns into a story, a
          myth. El Dorado has spawned stories and legends since the beginning.
          It's hard to mention another location other than Atlantis, that's
          generated so much literature and fiction. From Edgar Allan Poe's poem
          Eldorado to Voltaire's Candide to Wilson Harris's The secret ladder.
          Continuing in movies such as the Road to El Dorado, Zorro, that
          Indiana Jones movie we don't talk about, video games, music, and a
          list that only grows larger. When a location is so fictionalized as
          this, it can be hard to sort out the fantasy, especially when the myth
          has been a good part of it from the start.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first mention of El Dorado in writing seems to be in 1539; Gonzalo
          de la Pe&ntilde;a was chronicling that the Spanish explorer
          Sebasti&aacute;n de Benalc&aacute;zar was "in search of a land called
          El Dorado and Paqua and of great renown for its gold and gems."
        </p>
        <p>
          So early on, we have an idea that there are places with even more
          riches than already found. We must remember that this myth originates
          from the wealth found in Tenochtitl&aacute;n, primarily spread by
          Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo in his letters. The encounter with the
          Incas and their treasures set a standard for the riches people thought
          they could find if going deeper into the jungle. We could see Eldorado
          as a fictional excuse made up by the conquistadores to loot, ravage,
          enslave and conquer South America.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But El Dorado is just one part of a monumental fantasy, including
          locations such as Paititi (that we will return to later), The land of
          cinnamon, the Seven Cities of Cibola, and the fountain of youth. All
          these different locations were said to be somewhere in South America.
          Even if the mythical places all contain riches, it seems that it is
          not just the riches people are looking for when searching for them.
          They seem to look for a paradise where all is well. I think Voltaire
          may describe this idea well in Candide.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Quel est donc ce pays,&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . inconnu
            &agrave; tout le reste de la terre, et o&ugrave; toute la nature est
            d&rsquo;une esp&egrave;ce si diff&eacute;rente de la n&ocirc;tre?
            C&rsquo;est probablement le pays o&ugrave; tout va bien: car il faut
            absolument qu&rsquo;il y en ait un de cette esp&egrave;ce&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;What is this country&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; . which is unknown
          to the rest of the world, and where nature operates under laws so
          utterly different to ours? It is probably the land where all is well,
          for clearly, such a place has to exist,&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned, the location of the elusive El Dorado has shifted over
          the centuries. For some time, the place was somewhere inside Amazon.
          Conquistadores believed the warrior women from Herodotus' writings
          lived close to the Golden City. As with much else, European reports
          did exoticize indigenous women in South America, describing them as
          dangerous as the lands they were trying to civilize. These ideas stem
          from the priest Gaspar de Carvajal's writings; he claims to have
          witnessed all of this in 1541 on de Orellana's expedition down the
          Amazon river. Carvajal also describes how the Amazon women have walls
          of silver and vast hoards of wealth, and if they would give birth to a
          son, they kill the child and send it to the father. The idea that El
          Dorado must be in the Amazon lived on until quite late in history.
        </p>
        <p>
          But was El Dorado an invention of solely Europeans? Well, there is
          this hybrid nature to it; there were legends among the indigenous
          people touching on golden kings and essential rituals. But it's in all
          likelihood been grouped without discrimination by the Europeans later,
          twisting the legends into new myths. Take, for example, the idea of
          the Golden Kings, as described in "Historia general y natural de las
          Indias," written between 1514&ndash;49 by Gonzalo Fern&aacute;ndez de
          Oviedo. He describes the king and his riches as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >an exceedingly wealthy and important lord, and [it is further
            related that] with a certain resin or liquid which has a very fine
            odor he anoints himself every morning, and upon that ointment sets
            and sticks the gold ground [into dust] and as fine as is required
            for what has been stated, and his whole body is then left covered
            with gold from the soles of his feet to his head and as bright as a
            golden object fashioned by the hand of a skilled artisan regularly
            comes out. And it is my belief that if that chief is accustomed to
            doing that, he must possess some very rich mines of that particular
            quality of gold, for, in Tierra Firme, I have seen considerable
            quantities of it.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we also have to consider that the natives fueled these myths for
          survival. Gold was vital in these cultures, but it did not have a
          necessary monetary value. Gold was part of a religious and spiritual
          sphere; you could have gold without belonging to the elite. This is
          why I find the ideas of "survival gold" or apocalyptic gold sold to
          preppers a bit funny. Gold does not have any value when society
          doesn't care about it. I think you're better off stocking up on
          bullets, butter, and canned food. With that survival tip, let's

          But where does this idea of Lake Guatevita being El Dorado originate?
          The connection stems from an author named Juan Rodriguez Freyle, who
          is 1638, wrote about a ceremony as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;At this time, they stripped the heir to his skin and
            anointed him with a sticky earth on which they placed gold dust so
            that he was completely covered with this metal. They placed him on
            the raft /&hellip;/ and at his feet, they placed a great heap of
            gold and emeralds for him to offer to his god. In the raft with him
            went four principal subject chiefs, decked in plumes, crowns,
            bracelets, pendants, and earrings all of gold. They, too, were
            naked, and each one carried his offering /&hellip;/ when the raft
            reached the center of the lagoon, they raised a banner as a signal
            for silence.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >The gilded Indian then /.../ [threw] out all the pile of gold into
            the middle of the lake, and the chiefs who had accompanied him did
            the same on their own accounts.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Freyle is not the first to talk about a golden king, which was covered
          some 100 years earlier by Oviedo, but he adds the idea of golden items
          to be sacrificed in the lake. But Freyle isn't the only one talking
          about golden men and gold in lakes. There are other stories from this
          era about Paytiti, Manoa, and other places. Pushing the location of El
          Dorado further down the river, up on the other mountain, or another
          village. But note that the idea that El Dorado is a golden city is
          never mentioned in these sources, it's always a man, but it seems as
          if El Dorado at one point shifts from being hunted for riches to a
          hunt for paradise on earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a few things that proponents of Lake Guatevita use as proof is
          that the Muisca did have elaborate gold work. The fact that we have
          found an artifact depicting a golden raft with golden figures on it
          and that, as the show mentioned, golden artifacts were found at the
          bottom.

        <p>
          The Muisca were accomplished gold workers but hardly the only ones in
          South America. But we did find an artifact known as &ldquo;The Muisca
          raft&rdquo; in 1969. A local farmer found it in a cave in the Pasca
          municipality. It was part of an offering containing another golden
          procession figure and a large vessel. The connection to the El Dorado
          myth is mainly due to the work of Museo del Oro, who acquired the
          object in 69. Since then, they've worked hard to cultivate this idea;
          it seems more like a publicity stunt than actual scientific work.
        </p>
        <p>
          This raft is made of gold and depicts ten figures standing on them; it
          seems as if a couple of them are rowing the raft. Placed center in the
          scene is a more prominent figure who is richly decorated, indicating
          that it's someone of importance. But it's hard to say if it's a god,
          chief, or priest. The piece does not have any beading or seams that
          indicate soldering, so it's most likely manufactured with the lost-vax
          technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that's the gist of it, sure, it does sound a bit like the story,
          but I do not feel it's enough to conclusively say that we have Lake
          Guatevita as the origin of El Dorado.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how about all those gold artifacts in the lake? That must be where
          we get to the bottom of this, right? As it turns out, Hartley Knowles
          did lead a company called Contractors Limited, but it was in 1899, not
          1912, as the show indicates. But Knowles didn't excavate the lake; he
          drained it almost completely. It was only the mud left when the water
          was gone. As for the value, it ranges. Ancient Aliens claim some 20
          000 dollars, but other sources give different answers, and we know
          this is usually a red flag. But the best appraisal I found was that
          the items found by Knowles were sold at an auction at Sotheby's in
          London for &pound;500. Of the 63 lots put up, 22 of them were of gold,
          and most were small trinkets. The most significant piece was a
          breastplate weighing 226 grams or 8 ounces. Buyers later donated some
          of the artifacts to the British Museum; the discussion on how to
          donate something that's not yours is another question.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          They might have even gotten how the lake was formed wrong. It seems
          that Lake Guatevita might have been created by a collapsed salt dome,
          not a meteoric impact.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So is El Dorado real? No, it seems as if there never was a golden city
          hidden somewhere in South America waiting to be rediscovered. It
          started as a myth and seems to have expanded and grown to a more
          prominent legend.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We will somewhat return to El Dorado in a moment, but the show breaks
          off, asking why the alien came to visit us. David Childress explains
          the following:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"A number of researchers have suggested that Ancient Aliens have
            come to Earth primarily to mine gold. Zecharia Sitchin suggested
            that these extraterrestrials needed gold to spend it in the
            atmosphere and preserve their planet."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We also meet Derek Pitts, who explains that gold is instrumental in
          different applications. Pitts is chief astronomer at the Frankin
          institute and seems to have been roped in here somehow. But yes, it's
          an instrumental metal and also misused. You'll find gold in everything
          from electronics to guitar strings.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Zecharia Sitchin had this idea that aliens from a different
          planet needed more gold for their atmosphere for some reason, and the
          best and closest place was earth. But these aliens got lazy and
          started to create slave and master races and all those racist ideas we
          have heard so many times. Sitchin claims to have learned this from
          Sumerian tablets, but he has never been able to prove he could read or
          translate them. I will not go more in-depth here since we have done it
          in the past. But I think a Zecharia Special might be coming sooner
          rather than later.
        </p>
        <h3 id="paititi">Paititi</h3>
        <p>
          Even if we're going to leave El Dorado, in a sense, we will stay in
          South America but circle back to a place we mentioned a few moments
          ago. Paititi. The show introduces this section&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          as if it is a fact that aliens came here to mine gold; they base this
          on a body of literature that includes the mystical place Paititi.
          Before we dig deeper, let's see what Ancient Aliens say about this
          mysterious location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, we don't get a great backstory on Paititi. The show
          stresses that it's not to be confused with El Dorado, even if it
          sounds almost the same. We have Gregory Deyermenjian, credited as a
          Paititi explorer, is trying to explain it as follows:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >El Dorado and Paititi are frequently confused. I see El Dorado as
            being that particular gold-producing site that was in northern South
            America, and Paititi having been another civilization
            contemporaneous with the Incas in the area of Peru, Bolivia, that
            has yet to be definitively found. And that&rsquo;s what part of my
            quest has been over these last 25 years.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the idea might be that El Dorado is where gold is made while
          Paititi is a different civilization connected to the Inca. Gregory has
          been searching for this city or civilization since 1984 and still does
          when I look him up. But according to an unspecified legend, one Inca
          road is supposed to lead an explorer to the lost city. Why the Inca
          people would build a road to another civilization is a bit unclear.
        </p>
        <p>
          But their search starts in Cusco, the navel of the empire, and the
          famous Coricancha (QOH-ree KAHN-cha). The golden enclosure. It's
          described that in 1559 the conquistadores tried to tear it down and
          built a church in its place. It's supposed to have a fabulous gilded
          altar, but according to some records, it pales compared to how the
          Coricancha looked under Inca rules. Not only were there many golden
          statues, but sheets of gold also covered the wall.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We meet another explorer named Brian Foerster, who explains the Inca
          relation to gold as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Gold was important with the Inca because it was the sweat of the
            Sun. The Sun was the highest deity of the Inca and therefore the
            sweat of the Sun represented the most sacred possession
            imaginable."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We then learn that we within Corichancha could find key evidence of
          extraterrestrial visitation; the show claims that the sun god Punchal
          points us in the right direction. Georgio Tsoukalos explains:
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Coricancha was famous for its gigantic golden disc that the
            ancient Inca worshiped. That was a symbol of a giant golden disc
            that allegedly landed from the sky in front of the Inca ruler
            Atahuallpa, and he had direct contact, according to the legends,
            with the Sky Gods."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The writers of the show then speculate that this golden disk inside
          the temple must be to honor an alien visitor. If the alien was this
          close to Cusco, would it not be easy to think that the city of Paititi
          must be nearby? We learn when the conquistadores sacked the navel of
          the Inca empire, the priests were prepared and moved the gold outside
          the city. Foerster continues to explain:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Before the entire group of Spanish was able to get into Cuzco, the
            priests found out about it and they had all of the gold from all of
            the temples brought up to Lake Puray and thrown into the center.
            None of it has been found, to this day. The amount of gold at
            today's prices would be in the billions."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          How he knows all this is unknown and why nobody has gone and fished
          that gold up. This section is closed out by more Foerster talking
          about UFOs entering and leaving the lake. He attributes these legends
          to the local people, and we see the show interviewing indigenous
          people of the area. They have some team on location talking with the
          people they claim to hold these beliefs. But we still have a white
          dude explaining what these people believe. It does not help that all
          the native people are women too. I feel they disagreed with what the
          show wanted to present and therefore cut the audio out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they leave the legend of Paititi here, not making us wiser on El
          Dorado or Paititi. So let us start to dig into this, then, shall we?
        </p>
        <p>
          Paititi might be one of the more unknown mystical sites, even if
          Shadow of the Tomb Raider has parts of its storyline there.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          When we look into the myth about Paititi we start to note the same
          patterns as with El Dorado. Early chronicles mention a legendary place
          but usually involved rich mines of a different sort. One early account
          involved a White King with large silver mines. Some chronicles do
          indicate that Paititi was a location, not a golden city, but a lake or
          a river that joins the river Manu. Diego and Martin de Zecenarro, two
          brothers part of an expedition, noted that Paititi was a river. But as
          so happens, there was a "very large town with a very large number of
          people and it is governed by four caciques and these have a lot of
          gold and silver tableware and that they sit on gold chairs." It might
          be good to put to the records that Mario Polia, an Italian
          archeologist, wrote in the Italian magazine Archeo 2002 that he had
          found records about Paititi. In the archives of Archivum Romanum
          Societatis Iesu or ARSI, a Jesuit order in Rome Polia had found a
          letter. In this letter, a man called Father Andrea Lopez is writing
          about a holy miracle in the city of Paititi. As he describes it, a
          very warlike country that uses gold, silver, and pearls for their pots
          like we use iron. We also see the idea of white people existing in
          South America pre-Columbus here since the father describes these
          people as being white, like Germans.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Going back to the Amazonian women we talked briefly about in relation
          to El Dorado was sometimes described as fair and pale. This is the
          idea of white gods; Europeans had visited these places in the past and
          could claim the land. Or that the natives treated them as gods when
          encountered because their god was white and bearded. Now it&rsquo;s a
          bit funny that we don&rsquo;t see this in their depictions, only in
          chronicles written by conquistadores.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to circle back to the miracle described by Father Lopes. The king
          of Paititi was mocking the cross but suddenly started to quote the
          Apostle Paul. Afterward, he falls to his knees and starts to venerate
          the cross. We don't know if the pope did bless the endeavor. But we
          don't learn the city's exact location except that it's some ten days
          walk out of Peru. The letter focuses more on the miracle than the site
          or legends about the city. The proponents claim that this is absolute
          proof that Paititi exists as an actual city, but they have not
          thoroughly dealt with the claims that it&rsquo;s a river or a lake
          without a prosperous town. Or a small town with nice chairs. They just
          ignore the other descriptions when it fits them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something more fascinating is the influence the indigenous people had
          on Paititi. Soon after the fall of the Inca empire, a myth started to
          spread about the Inkarri (ing-Kah-REE). This name combines the word
          Inca and a Quechuanized version of Rey or king in Spanish. This myth
          seems to incorporate two world-turning events for the Inca. The
          assassination of Atahualpa (ah-tah-WAHL-pah), the last independent
          Sapa Inca of the Tawantinsuyu, and a set of rebellions in
          1780-1783.&nbsp;

        <p>
          As for Atahualpa, he offered a room filled with precious metals to
          still the conquistador&rsquo;s greed. He assembles the room but he is
          not let free, the chronicles of the time mention the gold-filled room
          but leave out any commitments from the Spaniards. Instead of releasing
          him, the Inca Sapa is decapitated after being converted to
          Christianity. According to the Inkarri myth, the head was still alive
          and taken to Cusco where it was kept. But it would not be
          &rdquo;dead&rdquo; forever, it is rebuilding itself and when
          Inkarris&rsquo;s body is again whole he will judge the Spaniards and
          throw them out. The myth is also applied to the rebellion leader Tupac
          Amaru II who was also believed to have become an embodiment of
          Inkarri. Not in life but in death, common for both is that they
          suffered a death involving dismemberment. We see here how the Quechua
          and Aymara natives incorporate a messianic idea into a traditional
          belief.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea about Inkarri has grown since, and now some attribute the
          founding of cities such as Q'ero and Cusco to this hero. After he is
          done fighting the Spaniards, he was believed to have retired to
          Paititi. We did see with the El Dorado myth that the indigenous people
          fed into the legend, and the Inca has taken a more active role in
          developing the idea of Paititi. Here the city became more or less the
          paradise for the hero-god, the final resting place after accomplishing
          his messianic mission. It's almost as if they have re-appropriated a
          colonial idea of a golden city, a paradise on earth, back into their
          own culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          While El Dorado was more likely a man, Paititi might have been a real
          place, as we noted in the earlier sources it most likely was a river
          or lake. If there was a settlement, I don't think it was richer than
          the others and probably met the same end as the other Inca cities. So
          even if this idea might be more plausible, I find it unlikely that it
          lives up to the myth we have created around it. I think that these
          explorers we've seen would not accept less than a city of gold as the
          real Paititi, even if we found it.
        </p>

          They did talk about a few other things I'd like to circle back to. Now
          they mentioned Coricancha (QOH-ree KAHN-cha) and it was indeed a holy
          place and larger than the show seems to indicate. Coricancha was not a
          single temple to a diety, it was more of a district that housed the
          religious center of the people. Within the enclosure were different
          temples and rooms dedicated to the different cults such as the Sun,
          the Moon, and other celestial bodies. But also weather phenomena such
          as lightning and rainbows, in here we also find the "Garden of the
          Sun" and also temporary housing for royal mummies during celebrations.
          In it, we also found according to the indigenous chronicler Pachacuti
          Yamqui indigenous chronicler described a plaque detailing the Inca
          cosmos residing inside the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          It must have been an amazing place to visit and it's sad to think how
          much we have lost due to ignorance, greed, and religious zealots.
          Remember that Georgio talked about this being the home of a golden
          disk of Punchal that they worshipped. Some chronicles describe the
          idol of the sun as a golden disk. But it was also described by others
          such as Padre Bernab&eacute; Cobo century as three idols Inti, Churi
          Inti (son), and Inti Huauque (brother). The most important was the
          Inti idol or Punchau, depicted as a boy of 10 years with sandals and a
          tunic. According to the viceroy Francisco Toledo, it contained the
          vital organs of all previous Sapa Incas.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "It has a heart of dough in a golden chalice inside the body of the
          idol, this dough being of a powder made from the hearts of dead Incas
          /.../ It is surrounded by a form of golden medallions in order that,
          when struck by the sun, these should shine in such a way that one
          could never see the idol itself, but only the reflected brilliance of
          these medallions"
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the sun most likely was important as a deity, the chronicles
          have by their confusing accounts made us a disservice here. Often it
          seems as if the creator god Viracocha (wi-rah-KOH-cha) and the Sun are
          mixed up and have contradicting descriptions. But when we look at the
          mythology, the Sun is scarcely mentioned and mostly has a passive role
          in it. On the other hand Manco Capac, the first Sapa Inca was thought
          to be a descendant of the sun. So later ruling Sapa Incas was
          therefore also related to the sun. But there is a discussion on how
          important the sun really was within the Inca mythology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't find where Georgio got the idea that Atahualpa
          (ah-tah-WAHL-pah) had some disk land in front of him. But it sounds
          like the visions of Inca Yupanqui before the attack on Cusco by the
          Chanca. But it's one of those claims where Georgio would need to show
          his sources.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the gold in the lake that Foerster talked about. Well, it seems
          to go back to Atahualpa and his attempt to still the greed of the
          conquistadores, but in some legends, when the Spaniards killed the
          Sapa Inca anyway the people took the treasure back and threw it in the
          lake. I find it unlikely that the Spanish forces would let so much
          gold be carried off after having it collected in front of them. But it
          makes for a good story, if you have any other views on it please let
          me know.
        </p>
        <h3 id="alchemy">The Philosopher&rsquo;s stone and alchemy</h3>
        <p>
          We are going to leave South America now for this time and go a bit
          closer in time to 1924 and Tokyo Imperial University. Professor
          Hantaro Nagaoka is conducting an experiment where he directs 150 000
          volts of electricity at a mercury isotope for four hours. The goal is
          to remove one hydrogen proton from the nucleus of mercury and produce
          another element. Gold. When the experiment was over, Nagaoka looked at
          the result and realized that he had solved an ancient mystery. He had
          found the Philosopher's Stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is how Ancient Aliens start this section where we will focus
          more on alchemy and the Philosopher's Stone. It's, to be honest, and
          quite surprised decent science they will be depicted here. Except for
          what you just heard, while the goal of creating gold is true. The
          method, not as much. As I have been able to find Professor Nagaoka's
          experiment was performed by "running a mercury lamp for more than 200
          hours under a voltage of 226." He was not the only one, at the same
          time with a similar method Professor A. Miethe also performed this
          experiment. Showing it is possible to turn mercury into gold by
          removing atoms. Both of these experiments generated gold of less than
          a gram.

        <p>
          &nbsp;We're then taken on a stroll through historic attempts to turn
          metal into gold and Isaacs Newton's failed attempts in alchemy. They
          are doing a good job of showing how lazy people can be before we dream
          of turning scrap into riches with no effort. Today we hunt the idea of
          passive income on Etsy, things change but not that much.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are then taken to a lab at Irvine, California Irvine and meet what
          I assume is a co-worker of Michael Dennin. The show claims that Dr. AJ
          Shaka is using alchemy every day. He is in a very nice lab preparing
          an experiment and explaining how we today can create gold
        </p>
        <p>
          "We put mercury into one of these tubes, and mercury has a minor
          isotope of .15% mercury 196, it's called &ndash; and that isotope will
          actually pick up a neutron and, in about 23 hours, turn into gold."
        </p>
        <p>
          So with the help of nuclear reactors, they bombard the sample with
          radiation and does turn the mercury into gold quicker than we did in
          1920. They say that you could use other methods as we mentioned before
          but that radiation is the quickest and most efficient. This was
          honestly news to me and quite fascinating what we can do. By targeting
          molecules, we can do things people have dreamt of for ages. But before
          you run off to sell your gold before the price drops, you do not have
          to worry yet. Dr. Shaka explains that this method even if more
          efficient than what it was 100 years ago, might have some flaws.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2010 when this was aired, the price for a troy ounce of gold (or 31
          grams) was 1873 dollars. Dr. Shaka does not give us the weight but
          instead the value of the result and it is 0,3 cents. We also learn
          that the machine they use costs some $200 per hour to operate, to save
          you on some math the cost of only the machine lands on $4200. While
          impressive as proof it can be done it's not really at a stage where
          the gold markets will topple over soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since we today can create a tiny amount of gold, could they have
          done it in the past? The short answer is no. But let's hear them out.
          We're transported to ancient Egypt where the show wonders how ancient
          Egypt could have had so much gold.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;According to Ancient Astronaut Theorists, it is entirely
            possible that the Egyptians were capable of actually manufacturing
            gold and may have received otherworldly help to do so. If alchemical
            transmutations can be performed in a modest facility like the one at
            the University of California, Irvine, what might be possible with a
            larger reactor? A reactor, perhaps, the size of the Great Pyramid at
            Giza.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          We then have Childress and Dunn claiming that maybe the pyramid of
          Cheops probably was a nuclear reactor. Maybe it was used to create all
          the gold that ancient Egypt needed. Christoffer Dunn explains it as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"Looking into the blueprints of the internal arrangements,
            passageways, chambers, and shafts, the appearance of it to me did
            not resemble anything that would be used as a tomb. The precision
            with which it was built, the precision of the stones that go into
            building the Queen's Chamber, the Grand Gallery, and then, also,
            thousands and thousands of tons of granite that were brought down
            the Nile 500 miles to build the King's Chamber. These are the
            features that really shout out and say: There's something going on
            here, there's something different. It was built like a machine,
            perhaps it functioned like a machine."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of us can agree that this is just plain silly. They are correct
          in that gold was important in Egypt, but we don't need a gold
          generator to explain how they got them. We have a good understanding
          of the mining operations the Egyptians set up and have some 250 known
          sites of mining. Furthermore, there was trade with Punt and other
          locations for gold so getting the amounts needed was not too big of an
          issue for Egypt. If the gold would have been created, it probably
          would not have so many impurities as Egyptian gold has. If you start
          to look closer, you'll start to notice it comes in different colors
          and purity. Their methods to produce gold was good but rudimentary,
          but it seems as if they didn't really care about if the colors were
          different between pieces. The important part was that gold does not
          tarnish and therefore symbolizes eternity in a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Dunn's idea of the pyramid as a machine, we've looked into this
          part before. A bit in episode 10 and all the way back in episode 1.
          Dunn's arguments boil down to an "I want it to be true" and leaves it
          at that. The pyramid has no moving parts, nothing beneath it, nothing
          that would be able to interfere with something else. Dunn has done
          little to nothing to even make a dent in the scientific body of work
          that adds to our understanding of the site. I think we can leave it
          there for now.
        </p>
        <h2>Final words</h2>
        <p>
          We will leave here today, but make sure to come back next time! Then
          we will explore the rumors of an ancient library under the Sphinx and
          if the current dating is accurate. We&rsquo;ll also solve the enigma
          of Rennes-le-Ch&acirc;teau, a small french village where the priest
          suddenly had more wealth than anyone could dream of. Or at least
          according to the tale. We&rsquo;ll also look into whispers of the holy
          grail resting in a church outside Edinburgh, Scotland.
