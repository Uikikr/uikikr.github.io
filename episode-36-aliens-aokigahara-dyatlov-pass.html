        <p>
          Let's venture into a world of supposed mysteries. Could alien
          interference be behind the reputation of Aokigahara Forest, or as some
          have named it, "The Suicide forest," and the tragedy at Dyatlov Pass?
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media such as Ancient Aliens.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time we're looking into episode ten from season three, "Aliens
          and evil places." Or rather, we look into two of the sites brought up
          in the episode, Aokigahara Forest and Dyatlov Pass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aokigahara Forest has been called in popular media the "Suicide
          Forest," and we will look into the reason behind this. By
          investigating Japanese culture, history, and the area itself, we will
          try to find the reason for the forest's reputation. While I don't go
          into any gruesome details, the topic of suicide will be discussed in
          the episode. I've collected some resources below if you need help or
          someone to talk to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we're off to Russia and will dissect the Dyatlov Pass incident.
          What happened that night when nine hikers died, and what does the
          Disney movie Frozen have to do with the answer?

        </p>
        <p>
          Could the origin of this power be connected to extra-terrestrial
          experiments?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Probably not, but let's find out.</p>
        <p>
          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history
          and ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 35, and it will be filled
          with mystery and evil places. Well, not really, as it turns out, but
          we will look into parts of the Ancient Aliens episode "Aliens and evil
          places," from season three, episode 10. As noted, the quality of the
          alien claims has steadily gone downhill this season. So while the
          first half of the episode did offer some exciting things to talk
          about, the other half was a bit more vague and loose. So I decided to
          focus my effort on two of the mysteries in this episode, Aokigahara
          Forest, or as some have named it, "The Suicide forest" in Japan. So we
          will talk about suicide in this episode; while there will not be
          anything graphic, I can understand if some might want to skip ahead.
          You will find the time stamps in the show notes of this episode. If
          you are struggling with the thought of suicide or self-harm, please
          ensure you are ok and talk to someone. I've linked as many places to
          get help in the show notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          After our stay in Japan, we will venture toward the Ural Mountains and
          look into the Dyatlov pass incident. Could it be that nine experienced
          hikers met evil aliens? Or does a more plausible solution involve
          General Motors and Disney's movie Frozen?
        </p>
        <p>
          The other topics, such as the Black Mountain in Australia and the
          giant copper cauldrons in Russia, we will return to another day.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions

          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if you like the podcast, I would appreciate it if you left one of
          those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h3>Aokigahara forest&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>
          As you step into the forest, the noise and the alarm from the modern
          world slowly disappear. You make your way deeper into the woods. You
          start to hear the song of a Japanese white-eye, the chatter-like
          singing of the bush warbler, and the familiar greeting of a coo-coo
          bird. A fox seems to be calling on its mate in the distance, and while
          you enter the forest alone, there appear to be living creatures all
          around you. As you made your way toward the forest, the owner of a
          lakeside caf&eacute; stopped you and asked a couple of questions. Not
          too strange if you have the forest reputation in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trees block most of the sun, but it's not dark. You step out of
          the trampled path, trying to head deeper into the forest. The ground
          is covered in soft, spongy moss, and fallen leaves crunch beneath your
          feet. The smell of damp earth enters your nostrils, and the soil seems
          still wet from last night's rain. Staying on the trail is encouraged,
          but you can't help yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          You find a clearing and have a bit of rest beside a growth of
          Maianthemum dilatatum. Or maybe more commonly known as the "false lily
          of the valley." For a bit, you contemplate the signs that are put up
          at the entrance of the forest. Strangely, such a beautiful place has
          become a synonym for suffering and death. While sitting down, having
          some water, and basking in a few sun streaks, you can understand the
          name of the forest. Aokigahara-Jukai, translates to Blue Tree Meadow
          and Sea of Trees. But just like the woodland, there is something
          darker here. Mount Fuji, an old volcano, looms over the area. So does
          the name the forest is associated with, the Suicide Forrest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Aokigahara forest is indeed known to be a place where desperate
          people come to end their life. And I find it utterly vial that the
          Ancient Aliens proponents trying to blame this on aliens or
          extra-terrestrials. Mental health is one of those topics where
          pseudosciences need to keep their greedy hands out. As I mentioned
          above, we will deal with the topic of suicide, and if you struggle
          with these thoughts, you should pause here and go to the show notes,
          where I've linked places that offer help. Remember, it does get
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of people who have died by suicide has been high in Japan
          for a long time. But it's been declining rapidly in recent years, and
          the government is working hard to lower these numbers as much as
          possible. In 2021 the government of Japan created the first minister
          post dealing with loneliness and suicide prevention, and the post went
          to Tetsushi Sakamoto.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we deal with the claims regarding the Aokigahara forest, we
          might want to look into why Japan has so many deaths by suicide. This
          is not an easy question, and there is no single answer. Several things
          are in play here, and several studies have been done on the topic. One
          of the things that stick out is the cultural aspect of suicide. Japan
          does not have the same cultural stigma surrounding death by suicide
          as, for example, Europe or North America. Well, all countries under
          Christian influences tend to view suicide as wrong due to the
          religious connotation that suicide is a sin. This religious influence
          has not, of course, been part of the Japanese culture in the same way.
          Some also attribute this acceptance of suicide to a concept referred
          to as amae, an idea discussed by psychoanalyst Takeo Doi about a need,
          unique to Japan, of depending on and on and being in good standing
          with others. The behavior is, according to Doi, highly Japanese. In a
          society where the expectation of emotional dependence is strong,
          individuals who cannot fulfill these expectations or feel overwhelmed
          may experience shame, guilt, and failure. As a result, some
          individuals may view suicide as a way to escape these societal
          expectations and avoid burdening others with their perceived
          inadequacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Japan, the group is often put above the individual, and if you
          misbehave, the group might use social isolation and shaming as a
          punishment. This type of punishment can be very far-reaching and
          include more than family and peers, as Russel et al. points out in
          PCN. One of the more extreme forms of restoring one's social standing
          within the society is to perform what's in Japan known as kakugo no
          jisatsu. Or suicide of resolve, an act of trying to correct one's
          mistakes by killing oneself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically we see a strong tradition connecting suicide to mostly
          honor and the military. The method of death by suicide is most known
          as Seppuku. The earliest instance of this method is in the text
          "Chronicle of the Geography and Climate of Harima," written in 716 CE.
          According to this text, the first Seppuku took place close to Lake
          Biwa by a goddess due to a marriage dispute. It would reappear in 1219
          CE in the work Story of Ancient Matters vol 2. That time, it was a son
          from a noble family who turned into a life of thievery. Upon being
          cornered by the police in 989 CE, he died by Seppuku.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As the lordly rule in Japan started to disintegrate and was taken over
          by the emerging Samurai class in the 10th century, Seppeku increased.
          This is due to the idea of valor within the class. Rather than being
          captured, they would die by their own hand instead. A famous incident
          involving Seppeku involves Tametomo of the Minamoto clan in 1170 CE.
          According to the legend, if you are squeamish skip 30 seconds ahead.
          Upon being besieged and close to defeat performed Seppeku while
          standing and then proceeded to throw his entrails towards his enemy.
          The practice grew and became part of the Bushido code and inspired the
          "aesthetics of death" among the samurai class.
        </p>
        <p>
          The practice grew, and a new tradition formed as time passed, referred
          to as junshi or "suicide to follow one's lord to the grave." Samurais
          connected to a Lord would show their dedication and honor by killing
          themselves by Seppuku. These numbers became so large that there was an
          attempt to ban the practice. But even that could not stop this from
          still going on. The most famous example of junshi is, at least in the
          West, the story of the 47 Ronin. Yes, it's a movie starring Keanu
          Reeves, and I'm not sure why, but I kinda liked it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seppuku became such a large part of Japanese high society that it got
          six voluntary variations. Jiketsu, when it was in battle, Inseki when
          it was to own up for mistakes you might have committed. Kanshi is a
          form of protest against the misconduct of your lord, Memboku, when you
          were accused of something and wanted to prove your innocence. Then it
          was a sacrificial version offered by generals to save their families,
          and men would be spared after a defeat. Lastly, we have junshi, which
          has six subcategories ranging from an advanced Seppeku in anticipation
          of the lord's death to something referred to as "ronbara." This was
          when you committed Seppuku to save your honor because all your peers
          had done it, so it was peer pressure. Then you have three forced
          versions intended as a sort of punishment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I won't be graphical here, but let's discuss how the Seppeku was
          performed since we're pretty deep into this now. If you happen to be a
          bit squeamish, you might want to skip ahead a couple of moments.
          Seppeku translates to "cutting belly," so to perform the Seppeku, you
          took a blade and cut your lower abdomen from left to right, not more
          than 7 cm deep. If just slicing your belly was not painful enough, you
          would usually also hit organs, increasing the pain. This process could
          take several hours to die from, and in the beginning, you were
          intended to sit through it with honor and courage. Later you would add
          a second who cut off your head, after you had cut the abdomen, in one
          true strike. If they failed, that shame would fall upon them and their
          family, creating a new need for Seppeku. There were also three ways to
          cut the abdomen: in one motion, in a cross pattern, and in the last
          version, there were two horizontal and one vertical cut.&nbsp;

          So suicide has for centuries been a part of Japanese culture. But the
          reason for suicide has, of course, shifted throughout the years. I
          think it's not too much of a stretch to say that there are as many
          different reasons as people. But there are, of course, some reasons
          that occur more often than others. In a study by Masahide Koda et al.
          in 2022, they looked at suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic. The
          leading identified cause among men to kill themself by suicide was
          unemployment, followed by relationship distress, workplace
          relationships, and the Werner effect. Among women, it was a bit
          different. The leading cause was alcoholism, followed by
          schizophrenia, caregiving fatigue, and economic problems. Of course,
          these change throughout the year, but as we note, there is not an easy
          answer to Japan's suicide rate. We can see not only mental health
          issues but a combination of multiple things that need a multipronged
          solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          So armed with some background on the suicides in Japan, let's return
          to the forest. The alien proponents are trying to portray the area as
          mystical and evil as possible. Giorgio Tsoukalos, for example, say,
          quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There is no question that according to tradition that there are
          places that over time, have become evil but there's some type of
          mystique going on there that is not good nature, but rather evil."
        </p>
        <p>
          They don't give any excellent reason for why the forest would be evil
          or why aliens would cause it. Instead, they focus on death and gore,
          and we see what is supposed to be believed to be the remains of people
          killed by suicide and clothes or other belongings some have left
          behind. They don't at all really explore the area's history and
          instead focus on the number of people who kill themselves here.
          Suppose there were interested in telling a real story. In that case,
          there is one to be said about the Aokigahara forest if they had
          decided to talk with some real experts instead of Giorgio and Bill
          Birnes. Because there is an excellent documentary that could be done
          here based on reality.

          Aokigahara-Juka forest lay in the shadow of Mount Fuji, an old volcano
          responsible for the volcanic rock that the forest has as a floor. It
          is also part of the answer to one of the show's questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Like the Bermuda Triangle off the coast of North America, Aokigahara
          Forest is also said to contain high levels of electromagnetic energy.
          If so, might numerous recent sightings of UFOs near Mount Fuji be an
          indication that some sort of dimensional time-space portal might exist
          here &ndash; as Ancient Astronaut Theorists believe?" - Narrator
        </p>
        <p>
          Since magma flowing out of a volcano tends to contain iron, lava has a
          natural magnetism. The level of which varies depending on the iron
          level in the ground will affect the compass. An issue here is that the
          iron concentrations are relatively low within the area of Aokigahara,
          so to affect the compass, you need to keep it directly on the ground.
          It will point towards the magnetic north if held at an average height.
          Due to the lack of infrastructure in the area, the army of Japan has
          some of its training in the forest.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Mount Fuji has a special place within the Japanese religion, both
          within Shinto, Buddhism, and other minor cults. Several deities are
          associated with the mountain, such as Sakuya-Hime, the goddess of
          Mount Fuji and volcanoes. The mountain is an important religious
          pilgrimage to this day, and some 400 000 people do the spiritual climb
          to the top of the volcano each year. Within the spiritual setting, we
          find the first recorded instances of suicide in the forest. In 1340 a
          Buddhist monk named Shohkai killed himself in the act of Nyujoh. This
          is a practice where an ascetic monk goes on a diet of salt, bark,
          nuts, roots, and tea. The diet is supposed to help preserve the body
          as a natural mummy after death. They are then closing themselves in a
          rock chamber underground, where they meditate until they die. They
          believe that through this practice, they will save the sinful world
          and its people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bill Birnes claim something rather strange about Mount Fuji. He says
          quote "Mount Fuji in Japan is called world navel. It's one of the many
          places on planet Earth where according to legend, the earth meets the
          sky. /.../&nbsp; People go to Mount Fuji for the express purpose of
          committing suicide to release themselves from this life to pass
          through the axis mundi &ndash; the world navel &ndash; into the next
          life, into a higher plane. And that would explain the high level of
          suicides at Mount Fuji."
        </p>
        <p>
          For the starter, no, this doesn't really explain anything, as we will
          know for sure at the end of this. But the navel part is just bizarre
          for several reasons. Mount Fuji is not referred to as the navel of
          anything, and it would not make sense in Japanese culture. There are
          descriptions of caves within the mountains where stones are referred
          to as umbilical cords. This makes more sense since there is an idea
          that the umbilical cord can tell the child's future. Birnes have just
          taken the Inka idea of the navel being referred to as the center of
          the world and then just made some stuff up around it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So there are some historical and religious ties to the area, but is
          this why many people are killing themselves here today? The connection
          to Mount Fuji does have some link to it, but a large part of, this is
          not really the best word, its popularity could be attributed to
          popular media, journalistic reporting, or the Werther effect. In 1774
          Goetes' novel "The Sorrows of Young Werther" was published, and it was
          not long after young men would be seen brooding in yellow pants and a
          blue jacket. Some would, as the young main character Werther kill
          themself in a similar manner. As for Aokigahara, there is a famous
          Japanese novel that might have inspired some of the death. In 1961 the
          novel Nami no Tō, or Tower of Waves, written by the author Seichō
          Matsumoto was published. It had been published in serial form in the
          1950s before that. But the novel deals with the love between a married
          woman and a young prosecutor. The novel seems to deal with taboos
          within modern Japanese society. Unfortunately, the book is not
          officially published in English, but in the end, the woman goes to the
          Aokigahara to die by suicide. The story has become a best seller in
          Japan and has birthed nine different TV dramatizations. So it
          undoubtedly has a special place within Japanese culture, and it would
          not be strange that some have found inspiration in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We should not forget that the media have a paramount role in reporting
          on self-harm and suicide. I have followed the organization Save's
          guidelines on dealing with the topic of suicide for this article. But
          describing the place as some sort of mystical horror forest where
          people go to die is quite untasteful for several reasons. And as we
          have seen, the reasons why people come here to kill themself are
          numeral, and the background of the forest cover centuries of history
          and culture. Blaming it on an outside force we can't control is not
          helpful and, honestly, quite predatory on people's suffering. Claiming
          that people coming here will die due to aliens, ghosts, or some
          unknown evil might make help efforts less effective.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I think we now have a better understanding of the Aokigahara forest
          and the claims surrounding it. There's not one cause for its
          reputation, but we can improve it by changing how we speak about the
          forest. If you are struggling with mental health or thoughts about
          self-harm, there is help that you can get. I've added as many suicide
          hotlines as possible to the show notes, and there is other help to get
          out there. Depending on your country and location, you can get help
          with debt, work relations, or anything else you might struggle with.
          It does get better, it might take time, but it does get better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's leave the forest, Japan, and this topic for now. We're heading
          east to the Ural Mountains in Russia. Could one of the most famous
          mysteries have been caused by a few ill-tempered aliens?
        </p>
        <h3>Dyatlov Pass incident</h3>
        <p>
          The Dyatlov Pass incident might be beside the Bermuda Triangle, Loch
          Ness, and Jack the Ripper, one of the most famous mysteries out in the
          world. Suggested explanations for what happened during the night of
          January the first, 1959, ranged from Yeti attacks and avalanches to
          UFOs. Can we find some answers that might give us some insight into
          what happened that night in the remote regions of Russia?
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are unfamiliar with the story, the short version is that in
          1959 students and people from the Ural Polytechnical Institute formed
          a group for an expedition across the Ural Mountains. The group was led
          and assembled by Igor Dyatlov and included nine other people. In
          total, there were eight men and two women within the group. They were
          all rather experienced hikers, and this was far from their first
          expedition; unfortunately, it would be their last. The goal was to
          hike from Sverdlovsk, a city today called Yekaterinburg, to the
          mountain of Otorten. The Ancient Alien proponents wrongly claim that
          the mountain's name translates to "Do not go there." The name is a
          play on another well-known mountain called Vot-Tartan-Syakhyl in the
          Mansi language. This would translate to "The mountain that blows wind"
          or "Wind mountain." The Mansi refer to Otorten in their language as
          Lunt-Khusap or Lunt-Khusap-Syakhyl, which can be translated to "Goose
          Nest" or "Moauntain of the Goose Nest."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a bit of the issue with the Dyatlov incident, which occurred
          in Russia during the Soviet regime. First, we have a government that
          tends to classify everything, big and small, and still struggles with
          its openness. Add to this a language barrier; most sources are purely
          in Russian, and even if you're good with Slavic languages, they have a
          different alphabet, making translating any text rather complicated.
          Add to this 60 years of misinformation and popular science trying to
          sell the public a mystery, and we have the work cut out for us. To be
          honest, we might never know for sure what happened that night.
          However, there are some plausible theories out there. Then we have
          ideas like those we tend to cover on this show from Bill Birnes, for
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All nine hikers died. They were discovered by Soviet troops, in
          various stages of what can only be described as being mutilated. Their
          bodies were burned. Some suffered radiation poisoning. In one case, a
          hiker's tongue was missing. They had prematurely aged. Their skin was
          orange, their hair had turned gray. What could've explained this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          If we go back to February the first of 1969, things had not gone as
          the group had intended. They were supposed to have gone through the
          valley, and the plan seemed to have been making camp on the other
          side. Due to worsening weather conditions, poor visibility, and heavy
          snow, they seemed to have gotten lost and started to go westward,
          gaining elevation towards the top of Kholat-Syakhl. Another Mansi name
          translates to something like "Dead Top," likely due to the lack of
          vegetation and animal life on the top. After the incident, we start to
          see another translation of the name "Moauntian of the dead" or similar
          spookier versions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reasons why the group decided to make camp up there and not in the
          valley are unclear. Maybe the visibility had gotten worse, they were
          just too tired, or they felt that the shoulder of the hill offered a
          good amount of wind protection. When camping in the winter, a slope
          can be a good decision; what you want to avoid is a slope greater than
          20 degrees due to avalanche risk. Pitching the tent higher might also
          be preferred even if the winds are harder since wind and snow drift
          are less perilous than an avalanche. There are other reasons why
          higher is better when winter camping, such as the cold accumulates in
          the valleys. So for a person who has not done much camping in the
          winter, the spot might seem strange, but with experience as the
          Dyatlov group would have, it looks less weird. The Dyatlov group also
          constructed a sort of Bivouac shelter, as we can see in one of the
          last pictures of the group. Adding some more perceived protection for
          the campsite.
        </p>
        <p>
          One danger with snow is that it can hide the slope of a hill quite
          well. When Russia re-opened the Dyatlov investigation in 2019 after
          pleas from the Dyatlov Group Memorial Foundation, Andrei Kuryakov, the
          prosecutor in charge, made some new discoveries. Based on the
          photographs from 1959, recent surveys, and photogrammetry, it turned
          out that the location of the camp was in a steeper section of
          Kholat-Syakhl. This location is on a 30-degree slope and well within
          the range of avalanche danger. In 2021 Johan Gaume and Alexander
          Puzrin published "Mechanisms of slab avalanche release and impact in
          the Dyatlov Pass incident in 1959" in Nature's Earth and Environment.
          In this paper, they could show that it's plausible that the group was
          hit by a slab avalanche much smaller than your traditional
          avalanche.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          This would happen due to the Bivouac they created when setting camp,
          digging through the fresher snow into the more rigid slab and probably
          fracturing it higher up. Then the group passed the slab ultimately
          into a weaker layer and pitched the tent on the ground. Later in the
          night, a part of the slab started to slide on the softer layer into
          the tent. These layers were described back by investigators back in
          1959. Gaume and Puzring postulate that this slab was most likely the
          size of an SUV or other car. This would explain some of the damages
          the hikers got and why they would abandon the tent as they did.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Two of the hikers, Lyudmila and Alekseevich, were found to have severe
          chest trauma that was the most likely cause of their death, and
          Nikolai had severe head injuries. These damages Gaume and Puzring
          noted were in line with the injuries that would occur when getting hit
          by a slab of SUV size. To figure this out, they actually used data
          from General Motors, who, in the 70s, hit corpses with different
          weights and speeds. This was to calibrate seatbelts, though it turned
          out to be useful in other cases too.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little tidbit I learned is that the researchers used Disney's help
          to figure this out. Or rather, they asked the animators of the movie
          Frozen how they got those snow animations to be so accurate. With the
          help of the specialist who had created the code for the animation,
          they could repurpose this to do avalanche simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something that often is repeated is that this was a group of
          experienced hikers. However you might have all the experience in the
          world, but if your tent is suddenly hit by a soccer mom's primary mode
          of transportation in the middle of the night, you might take off too.
          They could have also feared a larger avalanche and went downhill for
          alternative shelter. Even if they panicked, they took the time to help
          their severely hurt friends. Andrei Kuryakov's investigation could
          also show that the weather dipped down towards minus thirty-five
          degrees Celsius. The winds reached 104 kilometers an hour, fourteen
          more kilometers, and you have an official hurricane. It was not the
          best condition to venture out in, even with good equipment, equipment
          they had left in the tent. I can imagine that the group was too
          fearful of returning and getting their things. But in these
          conditions, they would quickly succumb to the cold. Frostbite starts
          to set in within ten minutes in these conditions.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We see signs of hypothermia, such as paradoxical undressing, when the
          body, even if extremely cold, perceives itself as extremely hot. The
          cause of death for six of the group's members was hypothermia; the
          three others died from their injuries.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The strangeness some claim around the bodies is also easily explained
          in some cases. Birnes' mention regarding radioactivity could have been
          caused in two ways, either separately or in combination. Lanterns
          during the period often used a mantel made out of Thorium, a
          radioactive material, to create a white, clear, and long-lasting
          light. This mantel needed to be replaced and also gave out radiation,
          especially while being burned. Then the third largest Nuclear
          Powerplant accident happened in the region, the Kyshtym disaster, in
          1957. The accident contaminated thousands of square kilometers of land
          with what is referred to as the East Urals Radioactive Trace. This
          accident was covered up and unknown outside Russia until the 1980s.
          But it turns out that one of the members worked at the plant and took
          part in the cleanup in the aftermath, Yuri Krivonischenko.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some describe the skin's color as orange, but I also find descriptions
          that indicate it was more of a deep tan. A tan on the face would not
          be too unexpected, and every one of you who is skiing might know the
          struggle with goggle tan. The other claims usually brought up about
          "the mutilation," as some call it, are signs of human decomposition.
          Remember that the rescue team did not find them the next day. It was
          two months before someone came out that way. Two months are plenty of
          time for animals and natural processes to take place. As for the
          claims that the hair of the hikers had turned white or aged seems to
          be of dubious origins. If the Soviet government wanted to hide
          something strange, would they just not color the hair and put some
          makeup on? Paul Stonehill claims that there were some attempts to hide
          the bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          "At the end the bodies were buried in zinc coffins, I believe so no
          one would see."
        </p>
        <p>
          The zink coffins did, in fact, make me think for a moment. But the
          issue is that the material zink is not known to be well isolating
          towards nuclear material or other radiation. Zink is mainly used for
          galvanizing steel and iron so it won't corrode and as a cheap
          ingredient for alloys. And it's in the last part where we find out why
          some of the hikers were buried in zink coffins. Due to the relatively
          cheap cost of production, Zink coffins have been and still are used in
          Russia.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a chance we will never for sure know what did happen that
          night so long ago. However, this does not mean we don't have a decent
          understanding of what the most likely cause might have been. We don't
          need a lost Yeti or evil aliens when reality offers a more plausible
          explanation. A slab avalanche happened due to how they constructed the
          camp; hurt, scared, and disoriented, they stumble out of the tent.
          They help their wounded friends to get out and away. But the elements
          soon took hold of them, and that's how the story unfortunately ended.
          The group might have been experienced hikers, but sometimes even the
          most skilled experts make mistakes. In harsh conditions, even small
          mistakes might have significant consequences. Even today, with all our
          gear and access to expert training, hundreds of adept climbers and
          hikers die or get injured.
