        <hr />
        <p>
          Some might think Ancient Aliens is just a silly show on the Hitler
          channel; sorry, History Channel. Or "History!" as it's known today.
          Ancient Aliens have been on the air for 12 years. Even becoming a
          lousy video game, NFT:s, and a live show with tickets ranging from 45
          to 110 quid. But there's a darker side to the telecast, and in this
          short presentation, we'll look into the racist origin, the connections
          to nazism, and the appropriation of Native American culture. In the
          end, you'll be painfully aware that the Ancient Alien theory builds on
          nothing more than racist ideas that try to "Weekend at Bernie's" the
          corpse of colonialism.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We could primarily blame the Ancient Alien phenomenon on two persons,
          Erich von D&auml;niken and Zecharia Sitchin. Now there are more people
          to blame, but with this limited time, we'll focus on these two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's start with Erich von D&auml;niken, a convicted fraudster who
          sold more than 70 million books. The most famous is "Chariots of the
          gods." If you start to read his books, you'll find quotes like:
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Was the black race a failure and did the extraterrestrials change
            the genetic code by gene surgery and then program a white or a
            yellow race?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>The intended answer there is yes; we also find:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The evolutionists say that man descends from monkeys. Yet who has
            ever seen a white monkey? Or a dark ape with curly hair such as the
            black race has?"</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Why stop at racist ideas when we can add some evolution denialism to
          this too? Von D&auml;niken seems to believe that there is a chosen
          race and advocates eugenics. EVD claims that soon researchers will be
          able to tell us which combinations of races are desired and
          non-desired.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we see this tendency in his writings about monuments too.
          D&auml;niken often wonders how these primitive people could build such
          complex things but usually doesn't use that language when speaking
          about Stonehenge or the French Menhirs.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Zecharia Sitchin is a bit different and not as vocal. But he proposes
          in the book "The 12th Planet" that gold mining aliens created humans
          as a slave race. I've no idea how he got to 12 planets, but he is
          talking about aliens dividing humans into categories. Sitchin is also
          an evolution denialist, claiming there's no possible way that humans
          could evolve as we did.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this has been quite dark, but let's go a little bit darker. Even if
          Von D&auml;niken and Sitchin might have some racist ideas, they are
          not actively promoting nazism. Let me introduce Jan Van Helsing. No,
          Jan is not heavily into goth; we will get to the name soon. But"
          History!" have quoted his work several times. Not only in Ancient
          Aliens but also in other shows on the network. As you might have
          suspected, Van Helsing is not Jan's real name. It is Jan Udo Holey,
          and he picked the alias since dr. Van Helsing kills bloodsuckers in
          the book Dracula. You're correct if you feel that bloodsucker means
          something else. Holey uses it as a synonym for Jews who, with secret
          societies, control the world.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jan Udo Holey has been convicted for his Holocaust denialism, even if
          he does not see himself as anti-Semitic. He prefers the term skeptic.
          But he wrote a book called "Secret Societes," which he builds on "The
          protocol of Elders of Sion" and the work of holocaust deniers such as
          David Irving, David L. Hoggan, and Germar Rudolf.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jan Udo Holey's writings deal with history revision, hollow earth, and
          Nazi survivors in Antarctica. But also Nazi UFOs, Aryan aliens, and of
          course, a re-imagined Vril Society inspired by Norbert
          J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl. These are more open anti-Semitic
          and influencers within far-right esoterism than Holey. Even if the
          show does not name J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ettl, authors like David
          Childress and Bill Birnes are using them as references in their books.
          Both Childress and Birnes are frequent flyers on the show.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have in the episode called "Nazi wonder weapons" a discussion
          about Hans Kammler. The show claims that Kammler was involved in
          creating a stargate or maybe something they call Die Glocke. In
          reality, he was an overseer over V2/V1 production and part of the
          concentration camp development. Childress and others claim Kammler
          killed the involved scientists. But Kammler didn't order scientists
          killed but instead forced laborers, and POWs in what&rsquo;s known as
          the Arnsberg Forest massacre. Some 200 or more people including
          children were killed. If this is not history revision I do not know
          what is
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, I'd like to discuss the concept of "plastic shamans." The term
          usually applies to non-Native American people who pretend to be
          spiritual leaders or healers within this faith. But we could use it
          about Ancient Alien proponents too. Reading papers from Dr. Lisa
          Aldered and Dr. Rayna Green, we learn that even if Europeans have a
          long history of appropriating the cultures of the indigenous people.
          But it was not until the 70's New Age movement started to lay claim to
          native spirituality selling it to the white middle class. I'd say that
          the Ancient Astronaut theorists are part of this movement since they
          often build on the same sources, methods, and ideas. Even if they
          claim to be scientists, they are often more interested in selling
          books, talks, and merch.
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course, the Ancient Aliens also claim that Native American
          religion is, if not created, at least inspired by Extra-Terrestial
          beings. The best example of this might be when they talk about the
          Serpent Mound. They repeat the Mound Builder myth that white people
          build the mounds in America and claim that Native American tribes
          believe Serpent Mound to be an alien creation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Thomas Johnson, who is an alien proponent, says quote:&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"The Serpent Mound is a marker for space according to the Shawnee
            Indians. They're convinced that space travelers are using Serpent
            Mound as a marker."</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The Shawnee tribe has, after years of work, been invited back to the
          Serpent Mound, which they view as a holy site and part of their
          heritage. It is a victory, but new agers and alien theorists are still
          trying to appropriate the site. Some do light vandalism in attempting
          to bury chrystals in the mound. Others interrupt lectures by tribe
          chiefs demanding that they participate in smoking peace pipes. Members
          of the Shawnee tribe have done a lot to educate people but still have
          Ancient Aliens proponents telling them what they believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just a few tiny examples, and we have not even gotten to
          white gods, the Mormons, or Atlanteans. But you see that Ancient
          Aliens are deeply problematic, racist, and spreading colonial ideas.
          Next time someone asks, "What is the harm?" you can answer: Lot.&nbsp;
