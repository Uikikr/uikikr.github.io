          In this episode, we continue to look into Graham Hancock's new Netflix
          show, Ancient Apocalypse. Join Fredrik,<a

            who uses his background in archaeology</a
          >
          and a bit of skepticism to look deeper into the claims presented in
          the show. Is Hancock on to something we missed, or are there better
          explanations?
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the final chapter of our Ancient Apocalypse saga. We have
          looked at<a

            revisit the infamous Bimini Road</a
          >
          in the Bahamas. This site has long been touted as evidence of
          everything from extraterrestrial visitation to Graham Hancock's lost
          civilization. But is there any evidence to support these claims? We
          critically examine the site and its history, separating fact from
          fiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then delve into the world of old maps, including Piri Reis's map of
          the world, which has been the subject of much speculation and
          controversy. Is there any evidence suggesting that this map proves
          advanced ancient civilizations existed? We examine the claims and see
          where the evidence sets the course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, we're joined by archaeologist<a

            Jens Notroff</a
          >, an expert on G&ouml;bekli Tepe, an archaeological site that has
          been the subject of many pseudoscientific theories. Jens shares his
          knowledge and insights about the site, bringing you the latest
          research. He has also been involved in the<a

            project Tepe Telegrams</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, we explore the archeoastronomy claims made by Martin Sweatman
          and presented by Graham Hancock. Are these claims based on solid
          evidence or mere speculation? We examine the evidence and present a
          critical analysis.

        <p>
          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. I'm
          Fredrik, and I use my archaeology background to examine strange claims
          you encounter on the telly. This episode is our last chapter in the
          Ancient Apocalypse saga. We started this journey by exploring where
          Graham Hancock got some of his inspiration for his writing. After
          this, we have visited sites Hancock claims are evidence of an advanced
          Ice Age civilization. It's not gone so well for Hancocks' ideas when
          we have looked deeper into the places and the myths he has declared to
          be evidence for his ideas. If you start here, don't worry; you can see
          them out of order, but I recommend returning to episode 30 and
          starting from the beginning.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          And this is episode 33, and we have some fun things to discuss. First,
          we head out to the Bahamas and visit Bimini Road. Again! We looked at
          the site with Hancock in
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >episode 10 when we watched Ancient Aliens' "Underwater worlds."</a
          >
          We then get into old maps, especially Piri Reis's map of the world,
          and learn that things are not always what they seem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later we're visited by
          <a href="https://jensnotroff.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Jens Notroff</a
          >, who has worked on

            >G&ouml;bekli Tepe</a
          >
          and will share his knowledge about the site with us after we close
          this out by looking at the archaeoastronomical claims by
          <a

          about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations let's dig into the episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="BiminiRoad">Bimini Road</h2>
        <p>
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimini"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Bimini </a
          >is a tropical paradise in the heart of the Bahamas, not more than a
          skip and a jump from Miami. This small island may be pint-sized, but
          it packs a punch when it comes to natural beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine diving into the crystal-clear, turquoise waters and swimming
          among schools of vibrant fish and graceful sea turtles, or lounging on
          one of Bimini's pristine beaches, feeling the soft sand between your
          toes and listening to the gentle waves lapping at the shore. It's pure
          bliss!
        </p>
        <p>
          But Bimini is more than just a pretty face. The island has a rich
          history and culture, and you can explore the fascinating remnants of
          its
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rum-running"

            >rum-running</a

          past, with distilleries and bootlegger's caves dotting the landscape.
          The
          <a
            href="https://www.bahamas.com/plan-your-trip/things-to-do/bimini-museum"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Bimini Museum</a
          >
          is also a must-see, with exhibits celebrating the island's unique
          heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          But are we here for rum and beaches? Sadly not, our drinks served in
          coconuts with little umbrellas has to wait for another time. We're
          here due to the geological feature called
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimini_Road"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Bimini Road</a
          >. A formation that Hancock regards to be evidence of his ancient lost
          civilization in episode three, "<a
            href="https://www.ancientapocalypse.net/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >ghosts of a drowned world</a
          >." There's some lamenting about archaeologists who do not want to do
          research; therefore, no scientific study has occurred at Bimini
          Road.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how did this row of rocks become a thesis for the location of part
          of Atlantis? I'll give you a hint; the origin is one of our usual
          suspects. Can you guess who? If you thought it was
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Cayce"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Edgar Cayce</a
          >, great job! Edgar Cayce, or the sleeping prophet, a by now familiar
          name to us and if not the creator, is the inspiration of the Bimini
          Road.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Edgar did speak on Atlantis and Bimini islands a couple of times. If
          you go online and find information regarding Bimini Road, you'll most
          likely stumble upon one of Edgar Cayce's supposed reading that goes as
          follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >A portion of the temples may yet be discovered under the slime of
            ages and sea water near Bimini... Expect it in '68 or '69 - not so
            far away.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          If you go and start digging around in this quote, you will learn that
          the first part is from a "vision" in 1933. Cayce is here talking about
          where blueprints for the Atlantean power sources will be found. These
          blueprints are stored (Cayce, 1968) in three locations that are Egypt,
          Yucutan, and quote "<em

            the temples may yet be discovered under the slime of ages of sea
            water&mdash;near what is known as Bimini, off the coast of
            Florida.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the second part of the quote, we don't find it until 1938
          (prophecy 958-3), but as a date for when the first parts of Atlantis
          will rise again. "<em
            >And Poseidia will be among the first portions of Atlantis to rise
            again. Expect it in sixty-eight and sixty-nine ('68 and' 69); not so
            far away!</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          The 68 and 69 dates were added to the quote later to make his claim
          more accurate. You see, supporters of Cayce did, for lack of a better
          word, discover the Bimini road in 1968. So to get the master right,
          they declared the discovery and the prophecy connected (Card,
          2018).&nbsp;

        <p>
          The team who found the rocks and Hancock all agree that these can't be
          natural. Nature can't create these types of structures. If there's
          something nature is good at, it's creating incredible shapes (Feder,
          2020), something all new archaeologists learn during their first
          excavation. What we're looking at and what Hancock claims in the show
          is wrong is

          that force calcium-carbonate-rich waters through the sand (Shinn,
          2004; 2009). Scientists believe that the combination of evaporation
          and off-gassing of carbon dioxide helps trigger the precipitation of
          calcium carbonate.

            rel="noopener"
            >aragonite </a
          >crystals form between the sand grains. These crystals act like glue
          (Shinn, 2004; 2009), gradually uniting the grains to create a hardened
          limestone. The result is a stunning and unique rock that we know as
          beachrock. I also want to point out that these pillow-formed stones
          are found in other locations. James Randi pointed out that these can
          be found in Australia in 1981.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process does not need much time to form. We have examples of
          human skeleton remains and World War II artifacts embedded within this
          type of rock (Shinn, 2004). Several different tests have been carried
          out on the site. For example, Shinn and Tompkins took 17 core
          drillings (McKusick and Shinn, 1980), and when analyzed, they revealed
          that these blocks have identical strata. We would not expect this in
          quarried blocks since they come from different places in a quarry. But
          we know this is something we would expect if they were natural
          formations (McKusick and Shinn, 1980).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The great thing about limestone is that it incorporates organic
          material; due to this, we can use C14 to date the rock. Or rather, we
          can date the organic material within the stone. And it has been done,
          several samples were taken from the Bimini stones. The oldest date
          found was from around 3510 BP (Calvert, Introne, and Stipp, 1979). So
          the rocks were not even formed when Atlantis was supposed to have been
          destroyed. Something Hancock leaves out in his discussion. But we're
          not done here. Another big issue for Hancocks' theory is that the
          Atlantic ocean does not have room for a sunken continent (Feder,
          2020). Our understanding of the movement of the tectonic plates
          indicated that a continent couldn't have been submerged in the
          Atlantic.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With all these things in mind, it's strange that Hancock claims that
          "mainstream" science refuses to investigate Bimini road. As we have
          just discussed, scientists have looked into the claims from the start.
          But when nothing was there, we stopped spending time and money on it.
          I don't know if Graham is aware of these tests and investigations, but
          if he wants people to take him seriously, he should finance new tests.
          If the second round of tests shows different results than the initial,
          we might want to open the investigation again. But as the evidence are
          right now, it's solid as a rock that it's nothing more than. Well.
          Rocks.

          Maybe one of the more strange segments throughout is found in the same
          episode as Bimini Road. While on a boat in the clear Bahamian waters,
          Hancock brings up a copy of one of

          Ottoman fleet and cartographer who lived between 1465 and 1553 CE.
          While have done some of the most detailed maps of the Mediterranean
          (Brotton, 1997) of his time, he is most famous for his world map.
          Originally this map was in four parts, and sadly, we only have pieces
          of the South West map surviving until our days and fragments of the
          North West. On this map, Piri Reis lists his sources as follows.&nbsp;

            Arab map of India, four new Portuguese maps drawn according to the

        </p>
        <p>
          So far in the story, both Hancock and I would agree. But Graham has
          some, well, rather exciting ideas on how we should interpret the map.
          First, Graham commits a fairly common mistake. The island he points
          out as
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Cuba"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Cuba </a
          >is not, in fact, Cuba. So when he says, "<em
            >Efforts have been made to explain it as a badly drawn map of Cuba.
            And that just doesn't fly for me because you can't get it wrong.</em
          >" He is correct, and if we read what name Piri wrote on the island,
          we note that it's called Hispaniola (Mcintosh, 2000). Today part of
          the
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Dominican-Republic"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Dominican Republic</a
          >
          and the location of the first Spanish colonization attempt
          <a
            href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/histarch/research/dominican-republic/la-isabela/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >La Isabela</a
          >.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you look at it, you'll note that the island is facing the wrong
          direction compared to modern maps. The east coast has become the north
          coast. It's not uncommon that some landmasses were turned on old maps.
          For example, we see Greenland twisted about 90 degrees more than once
          (Mcintosh, 2000). Hispaniola might be rotated because Columbus thought
          the island was
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipango"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Cipango </a
          >(Mcintosh, 2000) when he first arrived in the New World. If we look
          at maps from the era, such as
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdapfel"
            target="_blank"

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Bordone</a
          >, and Isularium, Piri Reis match pretty well with their renditions of
          Cipango or Japan as we know it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But where is Cuba? Columbus and other explorers thought today's Cuba
          was part of the mainland (Mcintosh, 2000). So we find it above Panama;
          so much for the eerily accurate map. Piri Reis has marked this place
          as Cabo y Punta Ornofay (Mcintosh, 2000); today, this area is close to
          Rio San Juan. So it's pretty clear that Piri based this map segment on
          Columbus's idea that this was a large landmass that went far up north.
          Alright, so the map may not be as accurate as depicted in popular
          media, but how about the idea that Piri Reis has drawn the Bimini Road
          on the map?
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock claims that on the island, we now know depicts Hispaniola, a
          row of blocks can't be mountains. Graham's reason for this is that
          Piri Reis supposedly drew mountains differently. Since it's not a
          mountain range, it must be Bimini Road. Except, Piri Reis drew other
          maps. Take, for example, his book with Mediterranean maps
          <a
            href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libro_de_las_Materias_Marinas"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            ><em>Kit&acirc;b-ı Bahriye</em></a
          ><em>. </em>In it, we find maps of Crete, Sicily, and other locations
          with mountains, which look the same as on the world map.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So it seems as if there was not much luck with Hancock's claims about
          the northern part of the map. But how about the fact it depicts
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Antarctica</a
          >? Does mainstream science have some clever explanation for that? As a
          matter of fact, we do. First of all, if what we see is not part of
          South America, did the cartographers just skip everything south of
          Brazil until they hit Antarctica? If that were the case, would it not
          be more logical that there would be a gap between Brazil, which we can
          see, and Antarctica?
          <a

            >If we were to straighten the curled-up part</a
          >, it would be a better match for Argentina and the Falklands than
          Antarctica (Feagans, 2017). We should not forget the explanations Piri
          wrote about the different areas. Looking a bit closer, we see that a
          part of "Antarctica" is described as follows (Mcintosh, 2000).
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >"This country is barren. Everything is desolate and in ruins and it
            is said that large serpents are found here. For this reason the
            Portuguese infidels did not land on these shores and these shores
            are also said to be very hot.</em
          >" - Piri Reis - 1513.
        </p>
        <p>
          About the small island, it's claimed that "These islands are not
          inhabited, but spices are plentiful." Not really how we would describe
          Antarctica, right? You might now yell, "stop, what about the other map
          from
          <a
            href="https://www.jasoncolavito.com/oronteus-finaeus-antarctica-map.html"

            rel="noopener"
            >Oronteus Finaeus</a
          >?" The 1531 map is one of those cases where if you read what the
          creator wrote on the map, the mystery disappears. For the landmass,
          some suggest is a snowless Antarctica it's written: "<em
            >The Southern Land recently discovered but not yet completely
            known</em
          >." (Colavito, 2014). And if we read the longer legend at the bottom,
          we learn that Finaeus did not base this map on other older maps, but
          these are brand new (Colavito, 2014). The land area that Finaeus calls
          "Terra Australis" is most likely Tierra Del Fuego, discovered ten
          years earlier in 1520. But the idea of a southern landmass had already
          been theorized by Ptolemy around the second century CE. So when the
          news about Tierra Del Fuego reached Finaeus, he wrote it in as this
          theorized landmass but added that it still needs to be adequately
          explored.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock's claims regarding Bimini Road and the Piri Reis map seem
          highly unlikely with a better understanding of the sites. Like
          sandcastles, they crumbled and were washed away by the waves of
          knowledge. But let's leave the sandy beaches and our coconut drinks
          for now. We will head east and investigate a site that Hancock
          speculate is a warning, a warning from the past.

          Welcome to the Urfa Province in southwest Turkey. In this semi-arid
          Mediterranean landscape, located in the steep hills beneath the Taurus
          Mountains, we find an extraordinary site. G&ouml;bekli Tepe, possibly
          one of the oldest Megalithic construction. I could have talked about
          the site, but I decided we should bring an absolute ringer. So without
          further ado, let me introduce you to my next guest.

        <p>Hi, and thanks for having me.</p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Would you mind maybe introducing yourself a little bit to the audience
          that might not be too familiar with your work previously?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          Yes, of course. My name is Jens, Jens Nostroff; I am an archeologist
          currently working or for some time already working at the German
          Archeological Institute in Berlin. And I was many, many years; I think
          more than 12 or 14 years, involved in the excavations at Pre-Pottery
          Neolithic G&ouml;bekli Tepe, which probably is familiar to some of
          your viewers. And we were directing excavations and working at the
          site together with the local museum in &Ccedil;ay&ouml;n&uuml;.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          You have been involved in the Tepe Telegrams. It's a sort of blog, as
          I have come to understand it. Would you maybe mind share a little bit
          about that project and how it came to be?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, that's quite an interesting question because there was a point
          when the site of G&ouml;bekli Tepe reached some recognition in the
          media. And there was a lot of popular media reporting about it, and a
          lot of people were interested in the archeology of this site and the
          finds. And we soon noticed that the actual academic work, that the
          actual research results were pretty much almost invisible in the
          public discussion of the site, and a lot of the narrators that were
          floating around were dominated by now, let's say, distorted, distorted
          ideas about this site or plain wrong information about the excavations
          and the finds until a point where it really. Yeah.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Pretty much dove into pseudo-archeology, so really, the factually,
          totally wrong kind of information floating around and being multiplied
          and the discussion and before. Okay, something's going bad if the
          actual research data which is available. Which is there is pretty much
          not noticed in this whole discussion, and that was the idea to make it
          much more accessible than academic journals or conferences. And to
          have this kind of online repository of information with basic
          information about the site and with our ongoing research and ongoing
          excavations, just to offer a small glimpse into the state of research
          and work. And it worked, and in the end, the blog. The format was a
          blog form. It was well received and read.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          And when we talk about G&ouml;bekli Tepe, what do we really refer to
          then? Is it religious sites or.
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>Yeah, hitting, hitting the hotspot right away.</p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Well, if we rewind a little bit, what is G&ouml;bekli Tepe, and when
          was it discovered?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          Oh yeah yeah, let's maybe let's start this way and the site is already
          known as a Neolithic site since a survey in the 1960s, a joint survey
          by the University of Chicago and Istanbul. And the report about this
          was published a bit later in the eighties. And they had noted that
          among many Neolithic sites in the region, some of them had already
          been excavated, for example, the famous

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87ay%C3%B6n%C3%BC"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >&Ccedil;ay&ouml;n&uuml;</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there's no small amount of. G&ouml;bekli Tepe was noteworthy
          because a lot of Flint stone tools of Flint stone debris were lying
          around. And those it was under it. And this list, but more or less
          forgotten because there was nothing else significantly to be observed
          at first glance. Then in the 1990s and 1994, I think Klaus Schmidt,
          the former project leader of the G&ouml;bekli Tepe excavations, was on
          this list and had a survey list in hand visiting the area, visiting
          some of the places noted on this list. He also went to go back to
          Tepe, and he had the advantage, but he previously worked on another
          site nearby at Nevali &Ccedil;ori.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There for the first time, these characteristic T-shaped pillars were
          discovered of the smaller kind. Never literary dates a bit later when
          you tip, it's also a Neolithic site, but it resembles more what we
          also found at the temple. The smaller structures, the smaller pillars
          of a height of two meters, about two meters or less. And with this
          knowledge, he was able to recognize that some of these stones, small
          stone parts sticking out of the surface that could tip up where indeed
          worked. Stones much resembling the tops of these T-shaped pillars.
          And, of course, this quiet is his interest, his attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's how excavation work started. Bear, together with the local
          museum in &Ccedil;ay&ouml;n&uuml;, offer the next biggest city and is
          funded by the German Research Foundation and in a year ends up in a
          large-scale research project at the Orient Department and the Istanbul
          Department of the German Archeological Institute.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          And the dating of the site, what they set data to currently, and how
          has this date been concluded? What evidence do they have for it
          currently?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          So currently, the site dates to the pre-pottery Neolithic, which is
          the 10th millennium B.C., basically pre-pottery, Neolithic phases A,
          and B. So this is the chronological or the relative chronological
          background. We are moving in. These results are, first of all, of
          course, achieved by dating the material culture through the typical
          archeological method to compare and analogies which are very typical
          stone tools like projectile points and arrowheads, but also blades and
          knives, and they all are without a question, a dating to the
          pre-pottery in their culture because we know these tools from many,
          many other sites since the the the whole cultural complex was defined
          in the 1950s by Kathleen Kenyon.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course, this is not the only basis of the chronology at of we
          also did some other tests and some other methods where we used to
          obtain data for or for the finds and features, for example, most
          famously a radiocarbon dating where are some pieces of charcoal found
          in the wall cluster of some of the walls of G&ouml;bekli Temple, which
          dates to the 10th Millennium B.C. and at least give us a date when
          this wall plaster was applied to to the wall. Other dates are coming
          from inside the wall, from the mortar between and beyond the wall. So
          there are some reliable radiocarbon dates that definitely support the
          already achieved archeological dating.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          And do we know of for about how long the site was in use, especially
          the more temple-like area? I think the.
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, I mean, since we're covering our pre-pottery in Neolithic phases
          A and B, there is some used time visible there, but it's not quite
          clear. At least, that was my latest state of knowledge. Of course,
          work is going on, and with all the other sites around being excavated,
          this picture is suddenly changing over time. But what I wanted to say
          is that it's not quite clear if there was a constant occupation,
          constant use of this site, or if there was recurring use.
        </p>
        <p>
          People were coming back, repairing sites, and reusing sites. So
          overall, these later structures, we certainly have used them going
          well into the eighth millennium B.C. So it's quite a long time of use
          of people being present at the sites the site.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          This is, usually, if we go back to these more fringe ideas, presented
          as something that there broke archeology. Why is this notion often
          repeated on how G&ouml;bekli Tepe broke or revolutionized ideas within
          archeology?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, I'm aware of these narratives that force us to rethink and
          rewrite our previous image of hunter-gatherers, which might have to do
          with the distorted idea of what we thought about hunter-gatherers
          previously. I think a lot of the discussion being repeated is drawing
          from a very, very old concept of the Neolithic, and it's not
          reflecting the last 50 years of ongoing research where I mean,
          G&ouml;bekli Tepe, in the beginning, seemed like a special outlier,
          but it was not totally unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          We knew about the monumental architecture related to the pre-pottery
          Neolithic from the excavations at Jericho; for example, this famous
          tower is already quite an impressive monument. We already knew about
          the need of repeated gatherings of mobile groups to exchange
          information, strengthen social cohesion, and so on from his historical
          analogies, ethnographic analogies, and also from the archeological
          record.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking at the native sites, for example, where there are
          similar ideas we already discussed. So G&ouml;bekli tempers seemed so
          special also to archeologists because it was this strong focus on
          monumental architecture, which was all banned and which was a huge
          site compared to two other sites of the period when we are looking at
          the settlements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We already knew from &Ccedil;ay&ouml;n&uuml;, for example, which has a
          very distinct architecture as well, and also occasionally these
          special purpose buildings, but not in this massive, massive focus of
          this large number of special purpose buildings. So this was quite
          interesting. But meantime, with a lot of other sites in the area and
          excavation, this image also is getting quite sharper. And it shows us
          that this is a very specific phenomenon of the local culture. So
          G&ouml;bekli Tepe is not an outlier; it's not an exception. It's part
          of a number of larger sites in the very region, probably a verified
          finding by looking at the other parts of the material of culture and
          the iconography architecture. So we may cover an area of almost 200
          kilometers in the surroundings covering this communication zone of
          this community if you would like to put it like this.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          And do we know anything about how they construct? When did they use
          stones that were available locally, or were they imported? Have we
          found any tools?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          In the lucky situation where the quarries are right next to the actual
          mounds or the rock plateau surrounding the mound of G&ouml;bekli Tepe.
          And this is where the quarries are situated as well. And they know
          this because we, for one, found that the negative shapes where stones
          were removed. We also found a situation where there were half-finished
          or the remains of finished T-pillars there lying around, and a lot of
          tools were lying around as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we know which tools they use as well. And we are so sure that we
          found the quarries because there are some unfinished T-pillars still
          in the quarries as they were broken. At some point. And those are not
          used anymore, not transported like 300 meters of what it is to to the
          mound. So we know where the stone is coming from. We know the tools.
          So there's really no big mystery about how they made it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, we cannot say for sure how they were moving, going from A
          to B, because we were not there. But we see that very clear the past.
          There are there's a lot of sediment, for example, on the rock plateau
          as well, which must have come from somewhere. So the idea that they
          may be used soil or something to get kind of a path, there is
          something we might discuss about ideas. That's the thing in
          archeology, we don't know the truth, but we can offer possible
          scenarios and explanations. And we are fair enough to admit that we
          don't know something. Maybe this is what makes the real research data
          less sexy even than these absolute narratives coming from other
          actors.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, it's hard to compete with levitation guns and whatever the
          Ancient Aliens have proposed for moving these blocks. But do you know
          what sort of materials? Is it tuff? I know that Turkey is usually
          quite volcanic.
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          There is a volcanic stone around basalt mostly, which was used for
          vessels in particular and for grinding stones. The pillars themselves
          are made from limestone local limestone, which is, and this is also
          quite a nice explanation or a nice contribution to how they actually
          crafted this place. The limestone there is naturally appearing in
          layers of banks.
        </p>
        <p>
          So as always, a bank of limestone of a certain thickness. And if you
          want to cut such a raw pillar from the stone, you basically just
          follow these banks and remove these banks of stones. The limestone is
          rather soft. It's easily worked with a flint stone, for sure. I tried
          this. I can personally, personally confirm this is possible. So it's
          there's no magic needed to cut the local limestone, but the available
          tools at the time.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Do we know what alignments it might have? I know that Hancock talked a
          lot about astronomical alignments within site. Are we are aware of
          any? Or how is the, or has it been any, studies archeoastronomy for
          this site?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          This definitely is is a topic we also we've also looking into and
          something I personally wouldn't exclude because if there's a
          possibility where it is a relation to people serving the sky, of
          course, that would be an interesting observation. And we know from
          other sites like famously, for example, Stonehenge that there are
          certain concepts integrated in the architecture as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing about G&ouml;bekli Tepe is that to my knowledge, so far
          there is no convincing evidence to link any astronomical phenomenon to
          the alignment of the pillars and all the things discussed so far and
          be addressed. They basically usually address these things on the blog
          as well. They are not convincing because they either are drawing from
          a very small number of samples, basically cherry-picking just a few
          examples and explaining these, but leaving out the total arrest, which
          then would remain unexplained and was relying on rather anecdotal data
          or they are not keeping in mind that what we are seeing at
          G&ouml;bekli Tepe is just the last part of a very long activity at
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          We know for sure that there was a lot of rebuilding and rearranging
          activity happening all the time and the pillars were reused, but at
          other enclosures, at other buildings, some pillars are now obviously
          standing and the wrong in the wrong place. Compared to their original
          position. Some are turned around; some are reworked, all the reliefs
          are erased, and new reliefs are added.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if there was a certain meaning to the arrangement of the pillars,
          it was changed multiple times. And this makes it very difficult for me
          to project a certain concept into the layout. And we should not forget
          that a lot of the building historical research done on the site
          suggests that these buildings they're subterranean and probably likely
          roofed. So this again makes a direct, direct connection of the pillars
          and something happening in the sky rather difficult, in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Why was the site abandoned? Do we know if there was any? I know
          Handcock brings up that it was ritually buried. Is this true, or do we
          know? Since you bring up that there's half finished piece as well? So
          is that sudden abandonment, or was it a planned abandonment?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          Now we're touching on the topic, which makes it difficult to be
          conclusive here because this is an ongoing excavation, so the
          colleagues are still working on the site but still excavated new finds
          and features. Of course, over time, this new finds our interpretation
          may change as well. And it did here. So too. I know that in the
          beginning, one of the ideas we were discussing was that maybe the
          burial of the enclosures was part of their construction concept from
          the very beginning, that it was the idea already to bury these
          buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is an idea coming basically from the huge 5.5 meter high pillars
          being found in very shallow pedestals. And we really had a difficult
          time imagining how these pillars might have stood upright for such a
          long time if there was no kind of backfilling, supporting, supporting
          the pillars. Meanwhile, further excavation and further building
          research and the discussion of maybe a roof putting pressure from
          above on these pillars or maybe wooden constructions supporting the
          pillars as well. And there's a lot more, more dynamic in the
          discussion of how these backfilling events happened, actually. I mean,
          they were backfilled in the end because we are now excavating them. So
          the sediment must have come from somewhere. The filling of this these
          buildings seemed very homogeneous. In the first process of excavation,
          there was a lot of rubble from the quarries.
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          There were a lot of stone tools, a lot of bones, remains of meals, and
          actually a lot of hunted animals. This is, by the way, why we know
          where the economy of the people, active advocate type of
          hunter-gatherers, all the animals and plants found so far there or the
          remains of animals and plants are strictly wild species, hunted
          species.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to return to the filling events, we now, with a lot of
          stratigraphic analysis and building history, building historical
          analysis, we now have a much, much more differentiated picture
          available of what happened there. And this research is still in
          progress and not finished. This seems as of yet that we have to think
          of both intentional backfilling events at some point and also natural
          filling events, for example, by earthquakes or erosion.
        </p>
        <p>
          And these two events may well be linked together as well, because
          maybe if the site was not in for a certain time and then an earthquake
          happened, some things were toppled over, walls were collapsing, and
          people were returning. They may have just cleaned it, but not removed
          all the rubble. So this is where we have these natural and artificial
          filling events that may go well, hand and hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          And also over a longer time than we maybe originally thought. But
          again, this is book and research, and I don't want to take away any
          information from the colleagues still working there still coming up
          with this interpretation falls is.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          No and that's something important to keep in mind with archaeology,
          it's a science like much else and information change as new research
          is conducted.
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          And we're happy to admit this. So this idea, but it's a secret
          archeology, legal dogma. And we want to defend this dogma of forever.
          It's ridiculous because if it's one thing constantly changing in
          archeology, it's our idea of what these finds may represent. And we're
          happy to get new ideas and to get a step further, to get another
          puzzle piece for the picture. So yeah.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Yeah. That's the whole idea with science, and why many of us got into
          it from the start to learn new things. It's not that we want to sit
          and read the same book over and over until we retire, but Jens, I will
          let you go. Is there anywhere listeners or viewers can go to read more
          from you?
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>
          I definitely recommend having a look at the Teppe Telegrams blog, but
          we'll be relaunched. Oh, it has been relaunched after a break over the
          pandemic when onsite was also limited. So colleagues have been working
          a lot with the science. But now I'm expecting that the blog will show
          new information and inform about ongoing work in research. And maybe I
          think there's also a lot of further literature collected and what
          people would like to read or to find further information as an FAQ
          about the site. So I think this would be the first resource I suggest
          to visit for. So that also the idea is discussed what the site
          actually is, which is not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's probably not a temple or ritual site or only a ritual site, as
          has been discussed in a lot of formats. But we would like to call the
          social have a meeting place for people because this notion of ritual
          versus profane is a very, very modern distinction and does not have at
          all to be applied to the prehistoric people using the site as well.
        </p>
        <p>Fredrik</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, yeah. Religion can be a communal sense, so to say, as we see in
          the other culture, you can have a social gathering combined with
          basically ritual services at the same time. Jens, thank you so much
          for your time.
        </p>
        <p>Jens</p>
        <p>Thank you for inviting me.</p>
        <p>
          Thank you so much for your time, Jens! His website and project links
          can be found in the show notes.

        <h2 id="StellarConnection">
          G&ouml;bekli Tepe - The stellar connection
        </h2>
        <p>
          Something we didn't bring up in this talk was the ideas of Martin
          Sweatman, who appears in the show. Or Dr. Sweatman, who is by day
          doing Chemical Engineering at the University of Edinburgh. But by
          night, he is researching archeoastronomy at G&ouml;bekli Tepe. His
          idea is that the builders of G&ouml;bekli Tepe did carve astronomical
          constellations on the pillars at the site as a message to future
          generations. Sweatman (2017) claims that on one pillar, we see
          depicted constellations like Gemini, Scorpio, Virgio, Piecies, and
          other Greek constellations. These constellations, Sweatman (2017)
          claims line up with the equinoxes as they were 10 950 BCE. Why is this
          important? It's the supposed date for the meteoric strike in the
          Younger Dryas Impact hypothesis, a large part of Hancock's theory for
          why his super civilization disappeared. But G&ouml;bekli Tepe was not
          constructed until Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (Notroff, Dietrich, and
          Schmidt, 2014) or, at the earliest, 9600 BCE. Sweatman has just
          handwaved away any criticism explaining this 1000-plus-year gap with
          "oral traditions."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But as you might have noted, I did say that Sweatman did use the Greek
          constellations. These are more or less the same we use today, but
          their origin is not Greek. The greeks imported most of these
          constellations from Mesopotamia, specifically the Babylonians
          (Hoffmann, 2021). There were some changes, so they didn't just
          copy-paste; they changed it a little so the teacher would not notice.
          I think we all know Aries, Latin for a ram, and what the Greeks called
          this constellation; the Babylonians referred to it as "Hired worker"
          (Hoffmann, 2021). There's quite a difference between a ram and a
          worker. We see this in other signs; Gemini is in Greece twins, but
          among the Babylonians, they were two sets of twins, a crook, or in
          some cases, "The true Shepard of Anu" (Hoffmann, 2017; 2021). Pieces
          are two fishes in Greece, but the Babylonians called it a swallow.
          Virgio was among the Babylonians described as a furrow, the trench in
          a plowed field, while, as we know, the Greeks referred to it as a
          maiden. Sure, there are similarities, like the Scorpio, who is the
          same in both cultures (Hoffmann, 2017; 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Babylonian constellations go back some time; the earliest accounts
          we find in a document called MUL-APIN (Hoffmann, 2021; Hunger and
          Steele, 2018). While the oldest clay tablet we have preserved is from
          around 700 BCE, it's argued that the text goes back to around
          1300-1000 BCE (Hunger and Steele, 2018). This is a compendium covering
          Babylonian astronomy and astrology. Note here that while these
          constellations go back some 3000 years, it's far from the 10 000 BCE
          date suggested by Sweatman. Even if we use the 9600 BCE, we know
          construction probably started at G&ouml;bekli Tepe; it's 8000 years
          between that and the earliest assumed account in Babylonian sources.
          That it would remain unchanged for so long is nearly impossible.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweatman and his co-author Tsikritsis, another chemical engineer,
          claim a depiction of a frog, an ibex, and a bird are representations
          of Vigrio, Gemini, and Pisces (Sweatman and Tsikritsis, 2017). The
          reasoning was that they feel that these symbols represented the
          depictions of the as the constellations would have looked like at 10
          000 BCE. But as you note this does not match the babylonian sources or
          the greek sources. They do not really explain this difference, instead
          Sweatman claim it&rsquo;s probable and this is what they see in their
          reconstructions of the night sky at this time. So they have done a
          Rorschach test and declared it evidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweatman and Tsikritsis claim they are statistically 99% correct. How
          they arrived at this statistical conclusion is dubious at best,
          especially when he does not present any archeological remains to
          support this. As Rebecca Bradley put it (2018), they assume that the
          carvings are astrological grouping without testing the evidence for
          that assumption.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not strange that Sweatman was invited; he has previously written
          on Hancocks' blog and is part of the YDI crowd. While he might be a
          decent Chemical Engineer, he is quite a lousy archaeologist. Sometimes
          intelligent people can be their worst enemy since they think they
          can't be fooled. Unfortunately for Sweatman, he managed to trick
          himself quite well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we will close the Hancock saga for now. Maybe we will return one
          day and have another look at Hancocks' ideas. There are things we've
          left out, and we have a whole bibliography to go through. Feel free to
          reach out and let me know if you want more content like this. There's
          a lot of pseudoarchaeology we can look at and discuss. But next time,
          we will be back with Giorgio and the gang to dig after those ancient
          aliens once again.
