          In this episode, we continue to look into Graham Hancock's new Netflix
          show, Ancient Apocalypse. Join Fredrik, who uses his background in
          archaeology and a bit of skepticism to look deeper into the claims
          presented in the show. Is Hancock on to something we missed, or are
          there better explanations?
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          This time we will continue looking into the sites he brings up as
          evidence. We will visit the large complex of Poverty Point and see
          what we know and how we know it&mdash;looking at some theories Hancock
          has left out. After that, we're back with the Serpent Mound, was
          Hancock banned from the site? We also look into the current discussion
          about the age of the mound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, we will go down underground and visit Derinkuyu. Was this a
          location people used to seek shelter from armies or aliens? Or was it
          an ark protecting humankind from the serpents in the sky?

          Hi, hello, and v&auml;lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is
          the podcast that usually examines the TV show Ancient Aliens. But this
          time, we are going for something different, the new Netflix series "<a
            href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81516751"
            target="_blank"

          <li>Big archaeology [inaudible]</li>
          <li>
            It's far more accurate, better made, and funny on purpose.&nbsp;
          </li>
          <li>Big archaeology [inaudible]</li>
          <li>Yeah, yeah yeah.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As it turns out, we're still looking into Graham Hancocks' "Ancient
          Apocalypse." Do the claims hold water to an archeologist or are there
          better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host, Fredrik, and this is episode 32. This time we will
          focus on the episodes "America's Lost Civilization" and "A fatal
          winter." So we will look at sites such as
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Point"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Poverty Point</a
          >,
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >Serpent Mound</a

            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Derinkuyu</a
          >. We have visited two of these sites in the past, but with an
          extraterrestrial hypothesis, so it might be interesting to see what is
          the same and different. We're also joined by Dr. Andrew Kinkella later
          in the episode.&nbsp;

        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="PovertyPoint">Poverty Point</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start our expedition to the Americas. Graham Hancock gives us a
          whole episode centered on north America based on his book "America
          Before." This episode starts with Hancock complaining about "<a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clovis_culture"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Clovis first</a
          >," claiming that this idea was taught until 2010. But as we learned
          from Dr. Bill Farley's insights in
          <a
            href="https://diggingupancientaliens.com/episode-31-ancient-apocalypse-ruins-of-knowledge.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >episode 31</a
          >, this could not be further from the truth. In fact, the debate over
          the earliest human inhabitants of the Americas had already been
          primarily settled by the 1990s.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But after finishing lamenting about Clovis, we're taken to a site
          called Poverty Point. The sight that unfolds before us is truly
          awe-inspiring. Six prominent ridges, arranged in a manner that almost
          resembles a Greek amphitheater, dominate the landscape. Along with
          these striking formations, we can see five original mounds and a vast
          plaza with several post circles (Kelly, 2015). This impressive
          structure, built between 1700-1100 BCE (Snow, Gonlin, and Siegel,
          2020), bears witness to the sophistication and skill of the people
          inhabiting this land.
        </p>

            <p>Pathway to mound A, Poverty Point</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The ridges, which boast a diameter of approximately 700 meters (2100
          feet), measure 10 kilometers (6 miles) (Feder, 2020). Among these
          remarkable structures, we find Mound A, which despite its lackluster
          name, stands tall behind the central square of the earthworks. This
          mound rises to an incredible height of 22 meters (72 feet), affording
          us an unparalleled view over the main plaza. Though the precise
          function of this impressive structure remains shrouded in mystery, it
          is clear that it played a vital role within the complex and the
          community that once called this place home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although the people who constructed Poverty Point had already
          domesticated crops such as squash and sunflowers (Snow, Gonlin, and
          Siegel, 2020), their way of life remained predominantly that of
          <a
            href="https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/28290/chapter-abstract/214481473?redirectedFrom=fulltext"

            rel="noopener"
            >hunter-fisher-gatherers</a
          >. The archaeological record provides ample evidence, including the
          discovery of stone artifacts like weights for fishing nets and
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spear-thrower"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >atlatls </a
          >(Kelly, 2015), a type of spear thrower. These findings suggest that
          the builders of Poverty Point were not yet reliant on farming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept that non-agrarian societies could construct such large and
          complex monuments was once considered far-fetched by many
          archaeologists. However, as more sites with reliable dating have been
          uncovered, this notion has become more widely accepted. It is now
          believed that more complex political structures capable of organizing
          and executing such impressive feats could have existed without relying
          on agriculture. It is worth noting, however, that while Poverty Point
          is evidence of some form of a political system, there is no evidence
          of
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >social stratification</a
          >
          within the society that built it (Kelly, 2015). But note that an
          outside force isn't necessary to explain these monuments.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some things we can rule out about Poverty Point. No burial
          has been found on the site (Kelly, 2015), not even in the mounds.
          There are also no signs of a permanent settlement at the site, which
          suggests that the people who came to Poverty Point, if not entirely
          nomadic, likely had their settlements elsewhere.&nbsp;

          While there is evidence of extensive long-distance trade at the site
          (Gibson and Carr, 2004), it is unlikely that trade was the primary
          function of Poverty Point, as there is no evidence of the exchange of
          non-durable items.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we go and listen to Graham Hancock, he believes the site to have
          held an
          <a
            href="https://www.grace.umd.edu/~tlaloc/archastro/cfaar_as.html"

            rel="noopener"
            >astronomical </a
          >function. In contradiction to Hancock's idea that he alone thinks so,
          some archaeologists would agree with him (Kelly, 2015). Kidder (2002)
          and other archaeologists argue that it is unlikely that migratory
          hunter-gatherers would require a stationary solstitial observatory.
          Other researchers take a more moderate stance, acknowledging that it
          is possible that the mounds have an astronomical alignment but that
          our current understanding is not sufficient to confirm this (Sassaman,
          2004).
        </p>
        <p>
          See, Graham, if you get down from that high horse and approach the
          material more honestly, we could have a meaningful conversation. When
          speaking with archaeologist Mark Brink Jr., Hancock even demonstrates
          this by accident, trying to get a negative answer to his
          statement.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >Why should the people who lived here and created this place, why
            should they not have been interested in the sky?</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p><em>"I'm not saying they weren't. No. I bet they were."</em></p>
        <p>
          The issue with celestial alignments is that they are subjective, and
          depending on the site, they can line up with several different things.
          At Poverty Point, we don't have any clear markers. In these cases, we
          would look for important stars or planets in mythology. Unfortunately,
          there are no surviving mythical accounts from the
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaic_Period_(Americas)"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >archaic period</a
          >
          when most of the site was built (Kelly, 2015). We also know that the
          site was reused in later periods. Mound D was created by a later
          culture around 700 CE (Snow, Gonlin, and Siegel, 2020). You could ask
          if the site has been changed to fit their religion and important
          alignments compared to the original creators.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there are other things the site could align to or represent other
          than astronomical. Some suggest it has a connection to the landscape,
          and a good case could be made that the ridges between mounds C and D
          reference the river (Kelly, 2015). Hancock is also leaving out a
          potential acoustic enhancement that could have been part of the reason
          for the site's construction. To have a chance to figure things out, we
          need to do more objective research and excavations. Speculation is all
          well and fine, but we need more than someone's opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why Hancock has chosen to bring up Poverty Point over
          <a
            href="https://heartoflouisiana.com/watson-brake/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Watson Brake</a
          >
          could be because Poverty Point looks better on camera. Watson Brake is
          much older, going back to possibly 4000 BCE (Saunders et al. 2005),
          with the first mounds constructed 500 years later. That's much, much
          older than Poverty Point. It might not be as impressive in size, but
          in age, it definitely takes the cake. The original creators at Watson
          Brake were hunter-fisher-gatherers. We know this due to the seeds
          found in the early layers; none show signs of domestication (Gibson
          and Carr, 2004). As mentioned, we see a temporary site occupation for
          about 500 years before the first mounds were constructed (Saunders et
          al. 2005).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hancock does spend a whole chapter on Watson Brake in his novel
          "America Before," (2019), so he's familiar with the site. He repeats
          the same theory that the mounds must be aligned to the solstices. He
          proves this by drawing lines through the mounds arranged in a circular
          shape claiming they "line up." I mean, items in a circle could align
          with several different things. Hancock also agrees that a nomadic
          culture might not have much use for a stationary solstice mound but
          argues that they must have had an advanced civilization come in
          teaching them this. Adding that, the evidence adds up toward
          worshipping a sky-ground deity. Hancock does not claim it's a snake,
          just implying it. And when we talk about snakes.

          We're no strangers with Serpent Mound on this show. If you recall, in
          episode 21, "Aliens in the old west," we delved into the Ancient Alien
          proponents' theories surrounding the site. However, it appears that
          Hancock has a personal stake in the matter, as he claims to have been
          banned from setting foot on the site. Hancock believes that the
          administration's decision to shut him out is motivated by personal and
          ideological reasons, as they seek to censor his views.
        </p>
        <p>
          I discovered some interesting details when I contacted the
          <a href="https://www.ohiohistory.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Ohio History Connection</a
          >
          for more information on Graham Hancock's visit to Serpent Mound.
          Hancock initially requested four days of commercial filming at the
          site, which would have required accommodating a significant number of
          people. Given the request's scope, it's unsurprising that the Ohio
          History Connection declined. Additionally, they confirmed that Hancock
          was never actually banned from the site, contrary to what had been
          suggested in some reports (2022, personal communication, 22 Feb).
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The commercial filming application by ITN was the only inquiry
            declined by the Ohio History Connection; Mr. Hancock was not
            prohibited from visiting the site as a member of the public.</em

          They were not allowed to film on-site, just as the note he read aloud
          stated. This stance from Ohio History Connection is not surprising if
          we look back at previous productions like Ancient Aliens and America
          Unearthed behavior (Colavito, 2014). Add to this that the
          <a href="https://www.shawnee-nsn.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
            >Shawnee tribes</a
          >
          acknowledge Serpent Mound as a holy site, and there have been
          incidents before (Pember, 2018, 2021; Welter, 2021). Chief Ben Barnes
          said (2021), "consider it to be a sacred site and we ask you to treat
          this remarkable place as you would any cathedral, synagogue, or
          mosque."&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          With all of these things in mind, the decision from Ohio History is
          reasonable and, to any other person, quite understandable. But Graham
          has not been interested in hearing any of this. Instead, he decided to
          doxx the staff member who answered his request by posting their
          contact details on Twitter.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham Hancock seems to believe that he has been banned from Serpent
          Mound because the Ohio History Connection is afraid that he will
          expose the truth about the mound's alignment toward the sun. According
          to Hancock, trees have been planted to conceal this fact. However,
          this claim seems a bit far-fetched, as there are signs marking the
          sun's positions during the solstices,
          <a

            rel="noopener"
            >as Carl Faegan (2022) can attest</a
          >. He could have learned this information if Hancock had simply
          refrained from filming and visited the park. Instead, he has acted
          petulantly and unprofessionally, behaving more like a spoiled child
          than a respected researcher.

          When it comes to dating the Serpent Mound, there is quite a bit of
          debate. Graham Hancock, however, seems unaware of this. In 2011, E.W.
          Hermann led a research project that took

            >C14 dates</a
          >
          from core drillings (2014) that suggest that the mound was from the

            rel="noopener"
            >Adena culture</a
          >, dating back to 500 BCE-200 CE. These datings align with the theory
          put forth by Putnam in 1890, based on the nearby burial mound.
          However, the current dating places the mound in the

          Fletcher et al. (1996). We could also add

          >(Lepper et al., 2018; Lepper, 2020; 2021) as evidence for the Fort
          Ancient date. While we know that the Adena culture did build mounds,
          we don't see any serpents represented in their art. The exception

          would be the Adena effigy pipe, but it's quite a leap from no snake to
          building a sizeable snake-based monument. I also want to stress that
          the new data are from core drillings, something we discussed
          previously that could be prone to contamination (Henriksen et al.,
          2019). Herrmann et al. (2014) also mention a buried

          removed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To clarify, the A-horizon in archaeology refers to the top layer of
          soil that has undergone significant biological activity, containing
          organic matter and nutrients that support plant growth. Depending on
          the specific context, this layer is typically found about 5 to 20 cm
          below the surface. Conversely, the

            >O-horizon</a

          refers to the surface layer of organic debris, such as leaves and
          twigs, that has not yet decomposed.

        <p>
          We should note that what we see today is a reconstruction mainly based
          on the drawings from E. Squire and E. Davis in 1846. But they were not
          the only ones documenting the site. In 1884, John Maclean created an
          illustration showing the monument with an addition. On top of the
          serpent and the egg or vulva, we also see a frog. Yes, a frog. Is this
          type of representation found somewhere else? As a matter of fact, we
          find a similar depiction over at

          (Duncan and Diaz-Granados, 2018). These ideas are also present in
          Shawnee traditions (Lepper, 2020). While the depictions of these
          themes are slightly different in Picture Cave, for example, they are
          undeniably similar. The Mississippian culture has more representations
          of the first woman and snakes (Duncan and Diaz-Granados, 2018), themes
          we don't see in Adena culture. A sandstone pipe with this motif was
          found in Ohio (Lepper, 2020).&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The question regarding Serpent Mound is far from settled. While Lepper
          and others present a strong case for a Fort Ancient date, Romain
          (2018) and Hermann (2014) have some compelling arguments. As all of
          these authors note in this public discussion, they agree that while
          ideas have been exchanged and improved hypotheses, we need more study
          of the site. Our current understanding is insufficient; and this is an
          excellent example of how science works. We need these discussions in
          journals to test ideas and get new knowledge. Hancock could learn
          something from this. On this bombshell, we will leave the Americas for
          now and head east and underground.

            >Cappadocia</a
          >, Turkey. A region famous for its unique geology, breathtaking hot
          air balloon rides, and mysterious underground cities. These cities,
          with their elaborate tunnel systems, carved deep into the ground and
          mountainsides, have captured the attention of archaeologists and
          tourists alike. With more than 200 underground cities identified
          (Yama&ccedil; and Tok, 2015), their origins and purposes have been the
          subject of much speculation. In episode 12, we discussed the Ancient
          Aliens' theories about the region with Bill Farley, who suggested that
          these cities were created as massive bunkers to save humans from an
          alien war. On the other hand, Hancock replaces aliens with a natural
          disaster to explain the underground cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dating these stone cities is not uncomplicated or impossible but
          harder, mainly due to the lack of organic material to date. Hancock's
          statement that "we can't date stone" is right and wrong. Dating the
          stone itself would be pointless since it would be millions of years
          old. We could try to date the quartz in the sediment with

          testing, but it would only work if it's been in the sunlight at
          construction and then buried. So in these cases, we would look at

          Let's take a moment to explore the dates associated with

            rel="noopener"
            >Derinkuyu</a
          >, one of the many underground cities in Cappadocia. The earliest date
          we can find related to Derinkuyu might be a Hittite tool, and authors
          speculate that the site could have started during the
          <a

          >era (Aydan and Ulusay, 2013). It could be argued that it's been moved
          or arrived later since it's a single find. But the earliest possible
          date for Derinkuyu might be between 1600 BCE and 1100 BCE. The theory
          is not improbable; the site of

          Yama&ccedil;, 2017). Unfortunately, we have not found any Hittite
          glyphs or typical architecture in the sites that could support the
          idea more (Gilli and Yama&ccedil;, 2017). While the Hittite date is
          plausible, archaeologists need more evidence to obtain a more precise
          date.

          As we delve deeper into the history of Cappadocia's underground
          cities, we discover accounts from ancient writers that provide us with
          further insight into their use.
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Xenophon"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Xenophon</a
          >, a Greek historian, and general, was in the region in 401 BCE
          leading the mercenary army the &ldquo;<a
            href="https://sites.psu.edu/cams180hoplite/battle-examples/march-of-the-ten-thousand/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >10 000</a
          >&rdquo;. They were hired to help
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cyrus-the-Younger"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Cyrus the younger</a
          >
          to take the Persian throne from his brother. Xenophone&nbsp; wrote
          about the underground houses with a "mouth like that of a well"
          (Xenophon 4.5.25). This indicates that the practice of constructing
          underground cities was already in use then.
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Vitruvius</a

          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygians"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Phrygians</a
          >, who succeeded the Hittites and dug shelters due to a lack of wood
          (The Ten Books on Architecture, 2.1.5). So we have some evidence that
          places the construction of some of these in the BCE era. However, most
          of the underground cities we see today were constructed between 600 CE
          to 1100 CE, and many already existing were expanded during this time
          (Yama&ccedil; and Tok, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
          These cities were not built and used once; they were often reused
          throughout the centuries to escape different enemies. It was not
          abandoned until quite recently. We are sure these were known and used
          in 1909 (Dawkins and Halliday, 1916) during the Armenian genocide in
          Turkey (Suny, 2015). Derinkuyu and other locals were probably not
          entirely abandoned until 1926. At that point, they became forgotten by
          the people left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we know a great deal about the age and use of these sites. But how
          Hancock get to the 10 000 BCE date is beyond me. He offers no evidence
          supporting the earlier date except for stone axes from the 10 000 BCE
          era has been found in the area. Cappadocia has a lot of
          <a
            href="https://geology.com/rocks/tuff.shtml"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Tuff</a
          >, a kind of vulcanic rock formed from the ashes after an
          eruption(&Ccedil;iner and Aydar, 2019; Aydan and Ulusay, 2013) and is
          usually quite soft and easy to work with. While it's possible to shape
          this rock with stone tools, we don't see any signs tying these cities
          to an earlier era. There's not a population large enough to do this
          type of excavation with stone tools in the region (Gilli and
          Yama&ccedil;, 2017). Surely not enough to create the number of cities
          that Hancock describes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Graham also agrees with Ancient Aliens that the site is unsuitable for
          defense. The explanation Hancock present is that enemies who find the
          entrance could smash the soft tuff door. It's not so brittle (Aydan
          and Ulusay, 2003; 2013) that it could have been done in minutes, which
          is why they have several of these round doors to block the entrance.
          If the enemy breached the gates, the population would still have a
          better chance of defense in the narrow tunnels than on the surface. We
          could apply the same idea to walled cities, the walls can be climbed,
          and the gates can be broken. Does this mean that the city walls must
          have a different purpose?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If we listen to Hancock, Derinkuyu was built for protection, not from
          people, but from nature. He claims that the surface becomes too cold
          to live on due to the meteoric impact and the floods. Therefore the
          people dug into the rock where there's always a stable temperature,
          like in a root cellar. I rented a
          <a
            href="https://www.andalucia.com/province/granada/huescar/galera/home.htm"

            rel="noopener"
            >place in Spain </a
          >dug out in the rock, and it had a pleasant indoor climate, even if it
          was scorching outside. No AC or other things are needed if you close
          the doors properly. Like a
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cellar"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >root cellar</a
          >, you must isolate the entrance properly (Melin, Berglund, and Monsen
          2010) for this to work. These sites have a lot of ventilation shafts,
          and in Derinkuyu, the temperatures have been monitored. The 7th floor
          may reach -11 celsius and usually stay between three to 15 degrees
          cooler than the ground floor (Aydan and Ulusay, 2013)&mdash;quite far
          from Hancocks' "comfortable" temperatures.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So the material evidence for Hancocks' idea is missing, but as we know
          it's not only material culture he looks at. There are also myths and
          legends. In this episode, we hear a fantastic tale from the
          <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zoroastrianism"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >Zoroastrian </a
          >religion. Graham tells about the ancient king Yima who is instructed
          to build an underground shelter before a long-lasting winter that a
          snake in the sky will tell when the time is near.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Except, as you might suspect, this is not the story written down in
          the Zoroastrian texts. The story is only possible if you mix and match
          from Zoroastrian text Avesta and then the Pahlavi texts (Colavito,
          2022). The god Ahura Mazda indeed tells Yima that winter is coming and
          that he needs to build a shelter (The Zend Avesta 2.22-2.26). The word
          used is Vara which is translated chiefly to a type of enclosure out of
          stone or a barn. Yima later asked how to build this Vara, and Ahura
          Mazda answered as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >O fair Yima, son of V&icirc;vanghat! Crush the earth with a stamp
            of thy heel, and then knead it with thy hands, as the potter does
            when kneading the potter's clay.</em
          >" The Zend Avesta 2.31.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the snake appears in the later texts of Pahlavi concerning demons.
          Nothing in the tellings refers to Yima or the story in Avesta (Pahlavi
          3.10), and it's more a description of their movement than being a
          snake shape (Colavitio, 2022). While Hancock has created a terrific
          story, it's not something we can use as evidence now right? We can't
          change the source material to fit our preferred idea.&nbsp;
