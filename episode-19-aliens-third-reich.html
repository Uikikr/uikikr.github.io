          Our host Fredrik continues the mission to discover what is genuine,
          fake, and somewhere in between on the TV-show Ancient Aliens. In this
          episode we will break down episode ten from season two (Ancient Aliens
          S02E10) called &ldquo;Aliens and the Third Reich&rdquo;. It originally
          aired on November 25 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          This episode will be a bit more serious one than usual. Even if we
          tend to research topics and claims within this episode contain a bit
          of extra of it. We will digg down into claims that Nazi Germany had
          contact with or built their advanced weponry upon lost alien
          technology. The ideas that on the surface seem to be just loony and a
          bit out there did contain a quite dark history that the History
          Channel seems to have been ignoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the show is built upon the ideas of Neo-Nazis, original nazis,
          spirutal sources and missinformation. Strong claims but my research is
          going in that direction. To back this up I&rsquo;ve added my sources
          and also a transcription of the show. If you know people who
          don&rsquo;t listen to podcasts they can read it instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a brief CW, it is an episode that focuses heavily on the second
          world war. We don&rsquo;t go into any details but we mention
          executions, suicide and the horrors of world war two.

        <hr />
        <p>
          It does not take us a long time to encounter a swastika, one second in
          and we have parades and Nazi flags all over the place. But alright, it
          supposed to be about the Nazi Germany so I guess it&rsquo;s
          appropriate. But then we kick into high gear with Henry Stevens who
          say:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;A lot of the information that we&rsquo;ve been told about
            the Second World War is wrong.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          This quote will set the tone for the episode, because this will be the
          main take away from the episode. We also meet a new face to us, Jim
          Marrs, a conspiracy theorist and UFO hunter.
        </p>
        <h3 id="nazisaucers">Nazi Saucers</h3>
        <h4 id="v1andv2rockets">V1 and V2 rockets</h4>
        <p>
          But after the intro we start to get inte to the gist of it. We are
          getting a lot of world war 2 footage in this first section, it is
          about nazi germany so I guess it&rsquo;s thematic at lest. But the
          narrator tells us that the Germans had the most advanced weaponry for
          its time and this is somewhat true. They did spend a lot of money on
          research during this period. But it helps when you have slave labour
          to keep costs down and humans to use as guinniepigs. But this is of
          course left out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Billy, our beloved Bill Barnes comes in and talks a little about
          the V1 and V2 rockets and they are marvelous inventions. But from the
          show it seems as if the Germans had invented the rockets all by
          themselves. But this is not true, prior to the war there were
          exchanges between universities. Von Braun, who was the one of the main
          people behind the V2 rocket, had reached out to Robert H. Goddard.
          Goddard was the one who is credited with the first liquid fueled
          rocket. So there was an ongoing exchange of ideas. But there&rsquo;s
          other who worked with early rocket design such as Robert
          Esnault-Pelterie, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Hermann Oberth. The last
          one we will get back to later.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure Germany was the first country to really develop a rocket that
          could be used in war. But the idea was already out there, it makes the
          comment from the narrator a little bit weird. Almost as he gives it
          away by accident.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;But what was the source of their incredible achievements?
            Were they simply smarter than their counterparts in other countries?
            Did they receive more funding and resources for their research?
            &ldquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes it was the funding and being lucky to have people like Von Braun
          and Oberth who could use it. I think we should again highlight that
          slave labour from the camps was used in the development.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this Linda Multon Howe joins in for a really quick soundbite.
          But she is wondering how Adolf Hitler could be so confident that
          Germany would take over the world. What we should read here is that
          they of course have some secrets. What might that be? Well if you have
          followed the series the answer is always aliens.
        </p>
        <h4 id="theblackforest">The Black Forest UFO Incident of 1936</h4>
        <p>
          So here we are going to go down a dark road that I feel confirms the
          show is resting on racist ideas. We have brought it up before but this
          time I think we&rsquo;ll have to really dig into the persons they talk
          about. So after Howe's question on where the confidence came from we
          opened up on the correct name for the area, Black forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          So back in episode five in season one they talk about this incident
          but there they called the area for the &ldquo;Freiburg Forest&rdquo;.
          But here it seems as if they at least get the name right this time
          around.
        </p>

        <p>
          We talked a little bit about the Freiburg forest UFO incident with
          Blake Smith from Monstertalk back in episode 9. We get a more detailed
          description of the events in there so if you want to hear more about
          that you&rsquo;ll need to go back to that episode.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But, they mention a name here. Jan Van Helsing. No, it is not the
          character from Bram Stoker's Dracula but we will discuss the pen name
          here. This person's real name is Jan Udo Holey, a German who has
          published a number of books. I think we will explain quite a lot about
          the character when we talk about how he chose that pen name.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="janudoholey">Jan Udo Holey (Jan Van Helsing)</h4>
        <p>
          But first Jan Udo Holey was born in 1967 as a second child in an
          esoteric family. His mother claimed that Jan is a seer and he got a
          lot of his influences here. He went on to become an interior decorator
          and seems after this have come in contact with the far right.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So Jan Udo Holey did select the name Van Helsing to honor the vampire
          hunter since Jan Udo believes the jews to be
          &ldquo;bloodsuckers&rdquo;. Since Van Helsing was fighting vampires he
          felt it was an appropriate name to take.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these claims about the UFO crash in the forest come from the book
          Secret Societies and Their Power in the Twentieth Century (or in
          German Geheimgesellschaften und ihre Macht im 20. Jahrhundert.). A
          book that is based on texts like &ldquo;The protocol of elders of
          zion&rdquo; and is building on other ideas from known holocaust
          deniers such as&nbsp; David Irving , David L. Hoggan and Germar Rudolf
          just to name a few. The book is banned in multiple countries due to
          the antisemitism in it. Since the book is banned Jan Udo has used this
          to sell more books by claiming to be a victim. That his critics are
          trying to silence him because they are afraid of the truth.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is a weird source for the History Channel to use so publicly in
          their show. But if you don&rsquo;t know about the hoilocaust denialism
          and anti semitism I guess it might sound credible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I think it&rsquo;s clear that we can write of the Black forest UFO
          as an invention of Jan Holey, he is clearly the source for this saga
          and have not provided any evidence for that it happened. There are
          claims about UFO:s and nazis in earlier sources such as Ernst
          Z&uuml;ndel and Miguel Serrano but they ties the UFO:s to
          antartica.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Jan, I refuse to call him Van Helsing, seems to go a bit further and
          add Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier ideas about the Vril Society
          from morning of the magicians. Jan Udo expands on the ideas and adds
          to the story, we will return to his writing later on. So with all of
          this I think we can for now write of Holeys claims as racist fiction.
          But all of this does not stop Bill Barnes from claiming:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;What exists are the reports of scientists who claim to have
          read reports of analysis done on that craft and the propulsions
          system.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          And I know this is TV and that giving a source can be tricky when
          trying to narrate a story, but it&rsquo;s not even a name of the
          scientists or reports. To be fair we&rsquo;re not sure that Bill
          Barnes talks about the German UFO crash here. So Ancient Aliens are so
          poor with their sources that you can&rsquo;t even trust the editing of
          the believers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then have Michel Dennin who comes in and discusses if it would be
          possible for us to reverse engineer alien technologie if encountered.
          His answer is that it depends, if it is similar to what we have now it
          could be simple. If it is something really different it would become
          nearly impossible. I think he has a point, but the show agrees that
          since it could be possible it&rsquo;s fine for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it would be good to discuss Michel Dennin a little bit, he has
          been in most of the episodes we have seen. But he isn&rsquo;t really
          part of the Ancient Astronaut believers, so he is somewhat of the
          resident, maybe not skeptic, but science contact. He is a professor at
          the University of California Irvine. He is a devout Catholic and has
          written a book called &ldquo;Divine Science&rdquo;, this is why I
          would not call him a skeptic. But Michel Dennin claims to have stayed
          on the show for all this time so he can influence the show. If this is
          the product after Dennins influence, maybe it could in fact be worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I think it&rsquo;s good to know that Dennin is not a believer but
          lending his credibility to these types of shows to talk about science.
          I believe this to be a somewhat double edged sword, at one part
          it&rsquo;s good to reach out and try to get new demographics
          interested in science. But at the same time these shows have had quite
          the artistic license toward facts. Dennin has been used and edited in
          ways often that makes it seems as if the prefered story of aliens
          presented by the show is true.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s leave professor Dennins background for now and get
          back to the show because now we&rsquo;re going to see the result from
          the reverse engineering of the spacecraft.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="viktorschauberger">Viktor Schauberger</h4>
        <p>
          We&rsquo;re going to move on to another German inventor named Viktor
          Schauberger the narrator start us of like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >According to reports discovered after the war, German scientists
            began experimenting with anti-gravity technologies shortly after the
            alleged discovery of the alien craft. One of these scientists was an
            Austrian inventor named Viktor Schauberger.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Michel Dennin comes in and says something that in a moment will make
          more sense.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >He was very instrumental in talking about creative ways of using
            fluid motion to generate propulsions. And a lot of it has to do with
            studying the way animals actually move through water or air.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So who is this Viktor Schauberger? Schauberger was born in 1885 and in
          1922 he created a system that was able to ship more wood than before
          down the rivers. The inspiration behind this was according to
          Schauberger found in nature and specially he attributes the
          trout.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So I think that this is what Dennin was referring to when being quoted
          here before, but none of what I just said made it into the show. But
          we then meet J&ouml;rg Schauberger who is the grandson of Viktor who
          is going to fill us in on the inventions. But I have to say that when
          it is a relative who defends your theories, it&rsquo;s not a great
          sign.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Viktor do bring up the trout but with a little twist:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;He looked especially on the trout standing still in a raging
            torrent. And he thought of, &lsquo;how can this fish stand still in
            this river?&rsquo; And then he thought of how nature works. And he
            stated, it&rsquo;s not the animal itself, it&rsquo;s air or water
            that moves this animal. A fish does not swim, it is swum, and a bird
            does not fly, it is flown. So, why can&rsquo;t we do this with
            machines? Move the air in a special way so that the vehicle is
            pulled, not pushed.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m not sure what they really mean by this, both the bird and
          the fish use muscle to move. Sure they somewhat rely on wind and
          currents in water to move quicker or more efficiently. But it&rsquo;s
          basically drag, just as a cyclist is riding behind someone else to
          save energy.
        </p>
        <h4 id="repulsin">Repulsin engine&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          But all this boils down to that they claim that Viktor Schuberger
          invented an vortex engine. This is a truth with modification
          Schuberger seems to have called a number of things he invented for
          &ldquo;Repulsin&rdquo;. One of them was an idea to use air
          that&rsquo;s sucked in through the disk, this somehow creates a vortex
          that can move an aircraft. They show you the invention on the screen
          and then a poor CGI video of how it would work. Why don&rsquo;t they
          just show the invention in action since they have it already? Well it
          seems to be due to the fact that the patent was rejected for not being
          possible and well, the invention never worked.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Schuberger had not given up though, they don&rsquo;t bring this up in
          the episode but he tried to make a new version of the Repulsin after
          gaining a lab at a concentration camp. Again, these are not great
          people, but due to his success with the lumber transport he had made a
          lot of connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Repulsin 2.0 was meant to use water and a few unknown additives to
          create petrol for submarines. Again how it would work or even be
          possible is left unknown but again it didn&rsquo;t work. But this
          should not be a surprise since except for the moving of logs his other
          inventions have gone terribly wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schuberger did dabble in water treatment and alternative energy
          sources. He managed to convince a few Siemens execs to build one of
          his ideas. After the device was built to Schubergers specifications
          the apparatus did implode and reached a temperature at 4000 degrees
          celcius. He got another chance from Siemens but the improved invention
          gave off so much radiation and heat that it melted the jewelry of
          people behind nearby walls. It does sound a bit as someone may have
          maybe exaggerated this story but Siemens cut ties after this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Schuberger got more paranoid toward the end of his life and today he
          is mostly known for vitalised water with his vortexes. Water can
          apparently die and this is bad somehow, but you can give it new life
          by spinning it really fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          David Childress then comes in to talk about Schauberger's vortex
          engines but is adding mercury to them. I did not find this anywhere
          other than in Childress' writing so I think this is something he added
          to make his mercury claims sound more plausible.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the show the grandson J&ouml;rg Schuberger claims that his
          grandfather got these ideas from ancient texts. I think you can almost
          guess where we will go now.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you guessed India and Vimanas you are perfectly right! So the
          Vimanas, one of Ancient Alien proponents' most favorite things. We
          will not spend too much time here since we have covered these in other
          episodes. But again they mix up the Rukma Vimana or Vaimanika Shastra,
          the book which is a hoax and was first published in 1953, with real
          Indian texts.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="haunebu">Haunebu&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          But we talked about this in the last episode and in previous episodes
          before this. So we&rsquo;re going to leave it here for now. But with
          this little segway we are going to move on to the, I guess, other
          result of the reverse engineered UFO. The Haunebu, but they
          don&rsquo;t spend much time on this. I found that weird since
          Childress has written a book on this thing. But it seems to have been
          a saucer shaped aircraft in different variations. One of them was 25
          meter in diameter and had windows on top. This invention is a fabric
          of imagination, by whom we will get to later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Jim Marrs claim the following towards the end of this section:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;Almost all my life I&rsquo;ve heard stories that the Nazis had
          obtained a flying saucer. And I do believe the Nazis were in touch
          with nonhuman intelligences that gave them the advanced technology
          that they developed right up to the end of the war.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          >I mean the Nazis lost! These intergalactic travelers who apparently
          used nuclear weapons in the past and can control volcanoes and
          tsunamis did lose against a ragtag bunch of humans with rifles. I mean
          do they hear how this sounds?
        </p>
        <h3 id="swastika">The Swastika</h3>
        <p>
          Here the show will go on a little side excursion. They are going to
          use the swastika as evidence that it must be aliens since it can be
          found all over the world. Michel Cremo tells us:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;&lsquo;Swastika&rsquo; is a Sanskrit word from ancient
            India. It means &ldquo;mark of good fortune,&rdquo; and the same
            symbol is found not only in ancient India but all over the
            world&hellip;in many different ancient cultures, ranging from Egypt
            to Iran to the cultures of the Americas.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;This is somewhat true, the meaning differs but swastika shaped
          symbols are found all over the world. Swastika originates from the
          word swasti and it does indeed mean luck, fortune or prosperity. The
          ending Ka is a suffix meaning of, so the literate translation to
          English would be &ldquo;of peace&rdquo; or so. Technically Cremo is
          right here but only technically.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Egypt on the other hand the symbol does not have been popular among
          the egyptians except for in imported goods and practices. There is one
          case of native depiction of the hooked cross I can find and it&rsquo;s
          a rock carving in the Eastern desert of upper egypt. It is a crude
          affair and does not give us much, the dating can be dynastic. The
          picture shows us two feets, one of them has a swastika in the foot and
          the other is slightly above the second foot's toes. You can find a
          copy of the carving at our webpage where you&rsquo;ll find all the
          sources too!
        </p>
        <p>Cremo continues:</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >In the ancient Sanskrit texts, it stated that the symbol of the
            Swastika is connected with extraterrestrial beings, such as the
            Hindu God Brahma. It&rsquo;s often used in worship in temples
            dedicated to extraterrestrial beings.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems to be a case where Cremo wants to read that the hindu gods
          are aliens and therefore they are aliens. But you have the swastika
          all over in hindu and asian culture since it&rsquo;s connected to so
          many things. You put it over doors, on paychecks and everywhere you
          would like to have some luck and prosperity. You also have it
          associated with the festivities of Diwali and sure it&rsquo;s
          connected to Brahma and other gods but not as a symbol of their
          divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is maybe great to mention here that the swastika does appear all
          over the world. We mentioned the one location in Egypt but you can
          find it in many other places. What the show wants you to think is that
          it means the same thing all over and looks identical everywhere. But
          that&rsquo;s not the case, if you compare a hindu swastika to a avar,
          an Greek tetraskelion, polish Ręce Swaroga or the Bashkirs swastika
          you will start to realize that even though it&rsquo;s similar
          it&rsquo;s not the same. The meaning differs too between different
          cultures and times. For medieval christians it symbolized Jesus and
          the authors of the gospels. For the native americans it was related to
          rain and fertility. Yes, it was luck and prosperity in some cultures
          too but we&rsquo;re bound to have some overlap. Most of these are in
          Asia where cross influence would be more expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how can it appear all over the world then? Well it&rsquo;s a
          simple symbol to be honest and have the element of movement in it that
          makes it interesting. We also again need to stress they have not been
          identical over time and locations.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Bill Barnes just pushes us of in the deep end saying:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;The Swastika turns up in the legends of indigenous peoples
            all around the world, and the theory was that it was a magical
            power, a magical symbol, given to these indigenous peoples by
            extraterrestrials, and that by using this symbol, it could ward off
            enemies, ward off evil, give them the power to not only survive but
            become supreme.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I really don&rsquo;t like how he is trying to fit the Nazi ideology
          over all of these people. The swastika was not connected to a sence of
          superiority before the Nazi&rsquo;s took it as their symbol. This
          clearly shows that Barnes does not care about the original sources, he
          wants to push his own narrative.

        <h4 id="esotericnazism">Esoteric Nazism and the spear of destiny</h4>
        <p>
          George Noory from coast-to-coast radio repeats a good old classic
          myth:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Hitler was obsessed with ancient mythology, he was obsessed
            with the occult, and more importantly, he was obsessed with trying
            to gain knowledge That he believed he could muster before anybody
            else could. So, he spent an inordinate amount of time, energy and
            money all over the planet to try to get information about things
            that would give Germany an upper hand.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I think we should have another excursion here and explore these occult
          and esoteric claims before we venture into the next section about the
          Vril Society.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of the occult, mythological and esoteric ideas connected to
          the Nazi is more or less a quite modern invention. The story is quite
          long and complex and could easily be its own episode or even whole
          series of them. I&rsquo;ll keep it to the shorter version but
          there&rsquo;s a lot more that we could talk about, if you&rsquo;re
          interested in an episode like this please let me know. But resources
          and reading suggestions on what&rsquo;s brought up can be found at
          diggingupancientaliens.com.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Where to start this is not an easy thing, so let&rsquo;s begin with
          the V&ouml;lkish movement who started the idea of one nation, one
          people. This movement led to subgroups such as the Thule-society that
          the show doesn't talk about really in this episode. But this subgroup
          had esoteric influences due to their inspiration from Ariosphist
          writers such as Guido von List and von Liebenfels who did have a more
          occult idea in their writing. The Thule society did in 1919 have an
          important role in building the early Deutsche Arbeiter-Partei or DAP.
          This would later evolve to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche
          Arbeiterpartei or NSDAP. But as soon Hitler had control over the party
          the connection with Thule Society was thoroughly separated. After this
          the society would wither and fade away.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why would Hitler do this? To start he was never a member of the Thule
          Society, only a few of leading Nazis was even invited as guests.
          Rudolph Hess seems to have been a member for a brief period, but the
          question is if he really was a member or if this is something that was
          invented later due to political reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hitler himself never had any love toward the V&ouml;lkish movement,
          almost having contempt for the organization and in &ldquo;Mein
          Kampf&rdquo; Hitler writes that these traveling scholars are not the
          way to spread the word. Hitler was not fond of mysticism or
          superstition and the same went for Goebbels. Already in 1933 when they
          seized power the party became hostile towards esoteric societies
          influenced by for example Theosophy, Rosicrucianism among others. Even
          Ariosophy was deemed to be one of the &ldquo;sects hostile to the
          state&rdquo;. When Rudolph Hess made his highly optimistic attempt to
          make peace and crashed in a Scottish field Hitler had enough. Hitler
          and Goebbles initiated a purge to clear out what remained of these
          esoteric ideas and societies. The task was maybe somewhat ironic given
          to chief of the German Police Heinrich Himmler, one of the few we know
          actually had an interest in the occult and esoteric.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Himmler is one of the few we know had an interest but he seems to have
          been keeping it mostly to himself. He tried to sow the ideas by
          creating research institutes and things but all attempts seem to have
          either ended at the planning stage or fizzled out. But Himmler seems
          to have been the one interested in finding the grail and did take
          people like Otto Rahn into the SS.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But these claims that Hitler was interested in the occult come from?
          Well some stem from a group of SS people who met up in 1950&rsquo;s
          Vienna. One of them was an engineer named Erich Halik who would come
          to publish articles about Neo-nazi esoterism and UFO:s. His first
          articles was in fact about that a UFO sighting was not something
          extra-terrestrial but a nazi Cult device that was used by high ranking
          gnostic christians to influence society.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we should not forget the French book &ldquo;The morning of the
          magicians&rdquo; who continued on these ideas. But maybe the greatest
          influence on the idea of Nazis being overly interested in ancient
          artefacts was Trevor Ravenscroft who wrote the book &ldquo;The spear
          of destiny&rdquo; published in 1973. In this book Ravenscroft claims
          that Hitler was obsessed with the spear who pierced Jesus at the
          crucifixion. This is based on the interviews he made with Walter
          Johannes Stein a philosopher, grail enthusiast and pioneer of
          anthroposophy. In these stories it&rsquo;s claimed that Stein found a
          copy of Parcival in an occult bookshop. The book had these strange
          notes on how to gain transcendent consciousness, alchemy and other
          occult teachings. Stein then learned that the book belonged to Hitler
          and gained Hitlers address who welcomed this jewish teacher in his
          home and told him about all these occult things.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But Stein died in 1956, so some time before the book and sure
          Ravenscroft could maybe have met him before this but. As you might
          expect there&rsquo;s no evidence that it would have happened. In an
          interview later he is supposed to have admitted to never having met
          Stein in life but gained the knowledge through a medium.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this thread of authors then moves down to Norbert
          J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl who we will talk more about
          shortly and of course Jan Udo Holey. From these we go to Childress and
          Jim Marrs, the books keep selling so I guess we will see more on these
          topics. But be aware that the ideas stems from Nazi sympatizers or
          spirtually channeled works.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As I mentioned this is only a brief summary of this topic and if you
          want to learn more I&rsquo;ve collected some good resources in our
          sources section. You should go and check those out. But now when
          we&rsquo;re a bit more armed with some background leading up to the
          next section we can continue.
        </p>
        <h3 id="vrilsociety">The Vril society</h3>
        <p>The narrator moves us to the next section by saying:</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;One of the main groups advising the Nazi leadership was a
            secret society known as the Vril. Members are said to have included
            the commander of the SS, Heinrich Himmler&hellip;Air Force Commander
            Hermann G&ouml;ring&hellip;and the head of the Nazi party, Martin
            Bormann.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          If you paid attention you know t hat except for a very few individuals
          the top of the Nazi party had any interest in the esoteric societies.
          In fact I can tell you with 100% certainty that none of these was
          involved in the Vril society. We will get into this in just a moment
          but let&rsquo;s first see what the show believes the Vril to be.
          Childress claims that the Vril society took its name from the Sanskrit
          word Prana, it does not. The show goes on and talks about how this
          Vril power could have been used. They then start to claim that these
          Vril researchers were in contact with beings from the Aldebaran Solar
          System. Bill Barnes explain that:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;They believed that Aryans ascended from a race of ETs and
            these ETs imbued this Aryan race with tremendous power and meant for
            them to be the master race on earth. And that was, in part, the
            justification for the Nazi political party to establish the Aryan
            supremacy on the planet earth.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright maybe we need to take just a moment here and try to figure out
          what is going on. What is this Vril, how can I be so sure that Goering
          was not part of the society and nazi aliens? Really?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Let&rsquo;s start with Vril, we talked a little bit about it back in
          episode nine. But let&rsquo;s recap that part here so you have a fresh
          framework. Vril comes from the novel &ldquo;<em>The Coming Race</em
          >&rdquo; written by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1871. The book is about a
          young traveler who encounters the race of Vril-ya, a superior angelic
          like race who gained powers from the force of Vril. Vril in the novel
          can be used for many things, both destroy anything or create and heal
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how did a sci-fi novel from 1871 become entagled with
          Nazi-ufology? For this we can thank Willy Ley who was in accademia
          during his time in Germany but who is maybe mostly known as a Sci-Fi
          writer. He wrote in the science fiction magazine &ldquo;<em
            >Analog Science Fiction and Fact</em
          >&rdquo; that in Germany there was a society trying to find Vril.
          Later research did uncover brochures by a group called
          <em
            >R eichsarbeitsgemeinschaft &lsquo;Das kommende
            Deutschland&rsquo;</em
          >, one of them called &ldquo;<em>Vril: Die kosmische urkraft</em
          >&rdquo; published in 1930. But in it they seem to talk more about
          Atlantis and free energy than other things. But this group was on the
          very fringe and did not do much more than release a second pamflet
          expanding on the idea.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vril Society was picked up in &ldquo;<em>Morning of the magicians</em
          >&rdquo; where the myth was expanded. But what we hear in the episode
          mostly builds on the writings from 1991 by Norbert
          J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ralf Ettl. That year they published the book
          &ldquo;<em>Das vril projekt</em>&rdquo; where they came to expand on
          the ideas of nazi esoterism and vril. Both of them belonged to a
          society started by Ettl building on Marcionism, the base of this
          belief system rests on the ideas of Marcion of Sinope. The short
          version is that the god in the old testament is evil and is not
          compatible with the teachings of Jesus. So his idea was that the
          supreme good god took pity on the lost people following the false evil
          god and sent his son Jesus to save them. So the god from the old
          testament is different from the god in the new testament and is an
          evil force. This is a quite clever way to paint the jews as extra
          evil. Both J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ettl of course also have strong
          ties to the far right movements.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in this book the Vril society becomes a larger organization and
          the author is starting to add sumerian ideas to the story. But the
          autors claim the society learned that a alien race from the Aldebaran
          system came here in the past and created a slave race and a master
          race. The aliens left these races alone and they started to mix. The
          aliens then created the Germanic people to bring order back to earth
          and get back to the original world order.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and Ettl seem to also be the original source for
          the Haunebu legends we talked about earlier. According to &ldquo;<em
            >Das Vril projekt</em
          >&rdquo; there were eight versions of the Haunebu spaceships and model
          7 or 8 was used to travel to Aldebaran to get help in the war effort.
          The pair also claimed in this book that the ideas from Alderbaran was
          closely tied to what we today view as National socialism and the
          anti-semitism is part of the aliens teachings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mythology would later be expanded on by Holey that we&rsquo;ve now
          encountered a few times already. But with this we can quite firmly
          confirm that the Vril society as described in these books never
          existed. There was a fringe group who did publish a small pamflett but
          that&rsquo;s as close we will come.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s move forward in the show, since we&rsquo;re going for
          the Indiana Jones connection. The show claims that the Vril society
          got Hitler to look for artifacts, but we know that this is something
          that was somewhat invented by Ravenscroft in the 70&rsquo;s. But it
          does not stop Childress from claiming:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >When you see, like, the Indiana Jones movies, which tend to focus
            on these secret Nazi occult expeditions around the world to find the
            Ark of the Covenant or the Spear of Destiny or some secret libraries
            and aliens, while those movies are fiction, they&rsquo;re very much
            based on truth.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also have Noory and Hitchcock confirming this idea. This section is
          really short and seems to rest upon the idea that if Hollywood makes a
          movie with a theme it must be true. To be honest I&rsquo;m not sure,
          could it be to fill time or that we&rsquo;ve done 20 episodes with no
          direct mention of Indiana Jones. Even if some talking heads have done
          their best cosplay hinting at it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="castlewewlsburg">Castle Wewelsburg</h4>
        <p>
          We then move to the Castle Wewelsburg, a renaissance castle whose
          current form was constructed 1603 even though a fortification has been
          on site since the 900 CE. The castle was under siege and later razed
          by Swedish troops led by Carl Gustav Wrangel during the 30 years war.
          A fun little fact I found.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show claims that Himmler brought mediums and psychics to this
          castle to contact aliens. Wewelsburg castle was important to Himmler
          and the grand plan advised by Himmler's personal mage Karl Maria
          Wiligut, was that this castle would be the main center for the SS.
          Wiligut was behind the design of the Totenkopfring. But Wiligut
          believed that the castle was destined to be the magical stronghold of
          the SS. But the castle never became more than a museum and an
          ideological education center for SS officers. The grand magical plan
          never came to be realized. There were never any magical rituals or
          mediums on the site, well except for Wiligut then, that any scholars
          have found.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn&rsquo;t before the 1950&rsquo;s it started to become important
          within the Nazi-esoterism due to the tie to Wiligut and that this is
          the only known location of the Black Sun. They don&rsquo;t spend much
          time on this symbol in the episode but this is supposedly why the
          place is magical more or less.
        </p>
        <h4 id="mariaorsic">Maria Orsic</h4>
        <p>
          But we have covered the castle and let&rsquo;s move on to the show.
          The claim here is that a highly influential member of the Vril Society
          had seances and contacted the aliens here. The name of this member is
          Maria Orsic. The spelling of her last name seems to differ and vary
          depending on the source, this is something you need to watch out for.
          If something as spelling differs widely depending on the source,
          it&rsquo;s probably made up.
        </p>
        <p>
          But according to the now popular myth Maria Orsic (or Marija
          Or&scaron;ić) was born 1895 in Zagreb Croatia. Later in life she moved
          to Munich where she became entangled with the Vril society a bit after
          1919. She was important since she was one of two who could
          telepathically contact the aliens from Aldebaran and she grew into an
          important female leader of the Vril society.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as you my dear listener might expect this is mostly inventions by
          authors we have brought up. Some put the finger towards Louis Pauwels
          and Jacques Bergier in &ldquo;the morning of the magicians&rdquo;.
          Even if they incorporated the Vril society in later editions
          I&rsquo;ve not been able to find Maria mentioned in the book.
          It&rsquo;s a thick book so it&rsquo;s not beyond impossible that I
          missed it and if you have the pagenumber let me know. But, from what
          I&rsquo;ve been able to find Marias creators are J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer
          and Ettl in &ldquo;<em>Das Vril projekt</em>&rdquo;. But the story
          grew with Jan Udo Holey and became more popular and with the help of
          the internet her backstory has grown even more.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But after the narrator have mentioned the castle Jim Marrs come in
          claiming:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Maria Orsic headed a group of women known as the
            &ldquo;Vriligen,&rdquo; or the female Vril members. And they were
            beautiful women. They grew their hair very long because they felt
            like their long hair could act as an antenna to the universal Vril
            energy.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          That the Vril had a special department with a special name seems to be
          an invention by Jim Marrs in this case. But J&uuml;rgen-Ratthofer and
          Ettl mentions that the Vril female members had long hair, maybe as an
          antenna but definitely to protest the short hair of the 1920s.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Bill Barnes repeats some claims that the show already have made and
          ends with
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The Germans were able to develop a technology so far in advance of
            the Allied technology, that people said they were helped by
            extraterrestrials. In fact, the one quote we have was from Hermann
            Oberth, and Dr. Oberth was in the German rocketry program. Hermann
            Oberth said, quote, &lsquo;We were helped by people from other
            worlds.&rsquo;</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          As we mentioned briefly before, Oberth was with von Braun partly the
          origin and the main drive of the rocket program. In the 50&rsquo;s and
          60&rsquo;s Oberth did talk about his beliefs in flying saucers and
          that UFO:s had been visiting earth. What he did not talk about or
          wrote was that the aliens worked with the nazis. The quote seems to
          come from a book called &ldquo;<em
            >Did Spacemen Colonise the Earth?</em
          >&rdquo; written by Robin Collyns. The book was published in 1974 so
          within Oberth lifetime but it seems to be dubious at best. In the book
          he supposedly said &ldquo;<em
            >We cannot take all the credit for our record advancements in
            certain scientific fields alone; we have been helped!&rsquo; When
            asked by whom, he replied: &lsquo;The people of other worlds!</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The quotes have been changed throughout time and the version Barnes
          quoting is from his own &ldquo;<em
            >The UFO Magazine: UFO Encyclopedia</em
          >&rdquo; published in 2004. Yet again an example on how the alienist
          changed the material to make it more compelling.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="ancientnukes">Ancient Nukes</h3>
        <p>
          We leave the esoteric ideas now for something more tangible, the
          splitting of the atom. The show brings up Otto Hahn and Fritz
          Strassmann as the people who discovered it but leaves out Lise Meitner
          and Otto Robert Frisch for some reason. The show talks a little bit
          about fission and that the news of the discovery spread around the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show then goes on talking about Albert Einstein's letter to
          president Rosewellt in August 1939. They then attribute this quote
          from Einstein to be a part of the letter
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >If successful, radioactive poisoning of the atmosphere and an
            annihilation of any life on Earth has been brought within the range
            of technical possibility.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But this quote originates from 1950 and the ideas of the hydrogen
          bombs. But in the letter Einstein talks about the discoveries of Fermi
          and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Joliot-Curie. He continues that it might be
          possible to use these discoveries to build a powerful weapon. Toward
          the end of the letter Einstein says that he has learned that the
          Germans have stopped selling uranium and that he believes the German
          scientists to have similar knowledge as the Americans.
        </p>
        <p>
          This letter became the start for the Manhattan project of which
          Einstein would never be a part of due to his left leaning
          politics.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The show moves on to make the following statement:</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >How were the German scientists in Berlin able to make this
            discovery before anyone else? Was this really a new breakthrough? Or
            might these scientists have rediscovered an ancient source of
            unimaginable power?</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Germans didn&rsquo;t succeed in something that was out of the
          realm of possibility. They based their work on what others had made so
          far. With the discovery of radioactive material in the early 1900 the
          work on these materials had been ongoing. The group of German
          scientists was the first to prove Nuclear fission to be possible but
          it was more or less just a question of time at this point. As Einstein
          mentions in the letter there were a number of scientists who were on
          the track of finding this out.
        </p>
        <h4 id="mohenjodaro">Mohenjo Daro</h4>
        <p>
          We then travel back in time to find evidence of these ancient nuclear
          weapons. Of course we&rsquo;re about to talk about Mohenjo Daro,
          Childress and Cremo repeating the ideas that were brought up back in
          episode 7. So we have the skeletons laying in the street and that
          there might be cases of trinitite in the desserts. But the only
          skeletons in Mohenjo Daro are found in the cemetery and no-one has so
          far been able to show a single piece of trinitite from the area. I
          also want to stress that Mohenjo Daro was built in mud bricks without
          mortars and still stands quite well today. Compare the town with
          pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and you will note that Mohenjo Daro
          is in good shape for being hit with a nuclear explosion.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show moves on to speak about Brahmastra weapons and hindu gods for
          reasons. Childress say the following rather strange quote:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Many of these Hindu gods did look different than humans. Generally
            they&rsquo;re often depicted as having blue skin, and that may well
            be describing extraterrestrials.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of this section is repeating the claims from before that the
          Nazis was looking for ancient powerfull weapons and knowledge. The
          show seems to hint that Hitler had contact with aliens, but why would
          he not have succeeded in producing atomic weapons? If they had the
          blueprints so to say, why did Hahn and Strassmann experiment to find
          the fission? They could just have started building the bombs from the
          start. The show also asks this question but does not answer it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the Germans didn&rsquo;t fail but chose to not invest their time
          and scientists in the endeavor. At a conference in 1939 the attending
          physisist theorised that the atomic bomb would be possible to create.
          But it would not be possible to do it earlier than five years. Hitler
          was informed about this and agreed that the endeavor would not be all
          too beneficial to the war effort. The research was still ongoing but
          did not take the same resources as the Manhattan project did.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We have to remember that the Manhattan project involved more countries
          than the USA and had an incredible amount of funding and
          scientists.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="dieglocke">Die Glocke (&ldquo;The Bell&rdquo;)</h3>
        <p>
          From ancient nuclear warfare we go to Poland and a mysterious valley
          near Ludwikowice Kłodzkie where a strange building stands. Ludwikowice
          was part of Germany even before the second world war and had a small
          forced labor camp that later became part of the Gross-Rosen
          concentration camp.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we meet a new face for the show, an Igor Witowski that says that
          the valley was closely guarded by the SS. There were three security
          rings and the henge or flytrap as they refer to it sometimes was in
          the inner of them. This structure is a bunch of pillars in a circle
          with a lintel on top.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show moves on saying that &ldquo;mainstream scholars&rdquo;
          believe the structure would become a cooling tower for a coal mine if
          it had not been abandoned. I think it would make sense since
          Wenceslaus mine is located just next to it, also abandoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the show moves on talking about the bell or &ldquo;Die
          Glocke&rdquo;, a machine built by the Nazis as a wonderweapon. Jim
          Marrs says that the project was so secret that Hitler didn&rsquo;t
          even know much about it. Steven M. Greer say:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >There&rsquo;s a great deal of evidence that suggests that the
            scientists, including Hermann Oberth and Wernher Von Braun and
            others, were working on a bell-shaped craft that was electromagnetic
            in its propulsion system.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The evidence for this is really unclear and to make things complicated
          this myth seems to originate with Witowski who claims to have seen
          secret reports kept by a military official. But he was not allowed to
          make any copies of the documents. So where Greer gets all the evidence
          is a bit of a mystery. But this has not stopped Jim Marrs and others
          from expanding on the story. But it&rsquo;s good to know that there is
          no earlier mention of this than Witowskis book &ldquo;Prawda o
          Wunderwaffe&rdquo; published in 2001.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe that before we start to examine what type of propulsion
          method this thing used, maybe we should really confirm that it
          existed. I don&rsquo;t really feel that they have managed to do this.
          You my dear listener might also wonder what with the henge, what was
          it used for?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          As I understand the show it seems as if for some reason they believe
          that the scientists tied Die Glocke to the lintels so it didn&rsquo;t
          fly away? It&rsquo;s highly unclear what they believe the function is
          and if the henge is the finished product. Early in the clip it seems
          as the nazis was still constructing. But I don&rsquo;t know what the
          idea is to be honest and why a concrete skeleton was needed, when some
          chains connected to a few concrete foundations would be quicker and
          cheaper.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then move on to discuss if time travel is possible, we have Deninn
          explaining Einstein's relativity theory. Since Einstein say it might
          be possible it must mean that the Nazi might have had access to time
          travel. So again, the aliens gave the nazis time travel and they still
          lost the war. Again, if they could share the time travel part I guess
          they could have shared the blueprints for an atomic bomb.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="hanskammler">Hans Kammler</h4>
        <p>
          We then using this discussion to talk about a SS
          Obergruppenf&uuml;hrer Hans Kammler. I&rsquo;ll let Jim Marrs set the
          tone here:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >SS general Hans Kammler was going to defect in exchange for
            immunity. But then, by the end of the war, he disappeared. So, where
            did Hans Kammler go, and what did he take?&nbsp; I think he took The
            Bell. Did he create a wormhole? Did he create a Stargate? And this
            is what the Nazis were working on.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          So according to Marrs this SS general was planning to defect, but
          instead chose to use the Glock and disappear. Henry Stevens fills in:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The engineers that worked on the bell were put to death by the SS.
            They didn&rsquo;t want this technology falling into the hands of the
            east or the west.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Childress closes out by adding that many scientists blew themself up
          in their labs to avoid capture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But how is it with all of this? There was a Hans Kammler in the SS who
          in fact did oversee secret weapons projects. But it was not Glocke, he
          oversaw the productions of the Messerschmitt Me 262 and the V2
          rockets. These were built by concentration camp inmates, this will be
          important in a second.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Hans Kammler was not your run of the mill background nazi, he was a
          true beliver who was deeply involved with the construction of
          Auschwitz. He worked hard in the party and could therefore advance
          through the ranks. He was also a cold person who as mentioned used
          forced labor from the camp, many died during the production to which
          he is credited to have said &ldquo;<em
            >Don't worry about the victims. The work must proceed ahead in the
            shortest time possible</em
          >&rdquo;. He does not strike me as a person who was planning to
          defect. His utter indifference to human suffering is staggering.
        </p>
        <p>
          The killed scientists then? I think this is an idea that comes from
          the Arnsberg Forest massacre. Kammler ordered some 200 men, women and
          children to be executed in the forest. These were not scientists but
          merely in the way of Kammler. But since Henry Stevens did not give any
          source or location I think this might be the people he talks about. A
          strange rewriting of history to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Hans Kammler then, what did happen to him? As the war was drawing
          closer to the loss he was ordered to regroup and fall back. On April
          16 1945 he telegraphed the command informing them of a new message
          center in Munich. The last known message seems to be on 23rd of April,
          asking his office manager to destroy V1 equipment near Berlin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The end of Kammler is not known for sure, but many witnesses indicate
          that he died while trying to escape. Either by an unknown cause or
          during a firefight. Since there is no photographic evidence or a body
          we can&rsquo;t be sure. The search has continued and some speculate
          that he escaped. But from what we do know Kammler was not near
          Ludwikowice. That he would have escaped with die Glocke is beyond the
          realm of possibilities.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We also learn the fate of Maria Orsic, according to the show she
          escaped with the Vril society. Maybe to Aldeban but who knows,
          apparently a mysterious note was left behind but I think we can agree
          that it must be as real as Maria.
        </p>
        <p>
          But George Noory really wanted to take the prize for the show's maybe
          most dangerous comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >The ironic thing about all of this is, years later in Kecksburg,
            Pennsylvania, a similar object was witnessed by a number of people
            That looked like The Bell. Is it possible that the Nazis perfected
            these things?&nbsp; Or is it possible that the aliens looked like
            Nazis in uniforms? How bizarre would that be?</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this dangerous? Well it&rsquo;s another attempt to try to clear
          the nazi crimes from the nazis. It&rsquo;s quite discusting to be
          honest to say that it was aliens, not nazis, that maybe was behind the
          holocaust. But hey, if they build their show on information from
          litteral neo nazis and holocaust deniers I mean. I&rsquo;m almost
          surprised that there was not more of this in the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, we&rsquo;re not done for some reason. The show talks about
          Hitlers suicide and to be honest it would have been a great spot to
          end on. I don&rsquo;t think people should kill themselves and if you
          struggle with those thoughts I really do hope you get the help you
          need. But for Hitler I&rsquo;m making an exception.

        <h3 id="operationpaperclip">Alien ingenuity and Operation Paperclip</h3>
        <p>
          This last part is a little bit all over the place but they talk about
          the Manhattan project that succeeded even if they did not have aliens
          helping them. We get some ideas that the Nazis was inspired by ancient
          Indian texts, that the rocket program was not possible without
          operation paperclip. So the Americans did find and bring scientists
          from germany back to the US, the sovjets did have a similar program
          called &ldquo;<em>Operation Osoaviakhim</em>&rdquo; doing the same
          thing.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest this part isn&rsquo;t that interesting, or rather they
          don&rsquo;t bring up any interesting things from Operation Paperclip
          or the rocket program. Allen Greenfield leaves us with this quote
          indicating that Von Braun had knowledge about aliens:
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >And I said to him, &ldquo;How did you develop that much technology
            so fast?&rdquo; And he looked down the rows of UFO files. And he
            said, &ldquo;We had help from them.&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;You
            mean, them?&rdquo; Meaning the aliens. He said, &ldquo;Yeah, we had
            help. We all got help from them.&rdquo; And that was, like, the eye-
            opening moment.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But it seems to be basically a rewrite of the quote from Oberth
          earlier. Greenfield claims that this was from 1970 when he had access
          to secret documents at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. But in 1970
          Braun got the role of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for
          Planning at the headquarters. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why he would
          be at this air force base then. We don&rsquo;t get to know more from
          Greenfield and it&rsquo;s here we end. The show closing out on if Nazi
          Germany had technology based on alien ideas and basically leaving us
          hanging.
