          Our host Fredrik continues the mission to discover what is genuine,
          fake, and somewhere in between on the TV-show Ancient Aliens. In this
          episode we will break down episode six from season two (Ancient Aliens
          S02E06) called &ldquo;Alien Tech&rdquo;. It originally aired in
          December 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be an episode full of information and research. I&rsquo;ve
          found a lot of interesting things among turtles, aliens and laser
          guns. This will be quite the ride so stay tuned.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;ve also wanted to plug my appearance on friend of the show
          Erik McLarens

          description to this show. Otherwise you will find it everywhere you
          usually find your podcasts.

        <p>
          Hi, hello and v&auml;lkommen to digging up ancient aliens. This is the
          podcast where we examine the TV-show Ancient Aliens. Do their claims
          hold water to an archeologist or are there better explanations out
          there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I am your host Fredrik and this is episode 17 and we are going to
          discuss episode six of season two (Ancient Aliens S02E06). It&rsquo;s
          named Alien Tech and was aired on December 2, 2010. We are up for
          quite the adventure this time around. This episode is quite scattered,
          we will discuss pirates, turtles, Alexander the great and Merlin. We
          will dig down on these and a few more new claims. I&rsquo;ve managed
          to uncover some interesting real background to quite a lot of these
          claims so sit down, relax and let&rsquo;s enjoy some Alien technology.
          But first a few things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources and reading suggestions
          on our website, diggingupancientaliens.com. There you also find
          contact info if you notice any mistakes or have any suggestions. And
          if&nbsp; you like the podcast I would really appreciate it if you left
          one of those fancy five star reviews that I&rsquo;ve heard so much
          about.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;ve also wanted to plug my appearance on friend of the show
          Erik McLarens &ldquo;Religion Wars&rdquo;.
          <a
            href="https://www.religiouswarspodcast.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
          >
            You should definitely check that out, a link will be in the
            description to this show </a
          >. Otherwise you will find it everywhere you usually find your
          podcasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enough of me jammering let&rsquo;s see what mysteries these locations
          might hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the show's intro we get the feeling the show will mostly be about
          weaponry but we will get a lot more than that. But to be honest I
          thought that this episode would be different and focus more on
          building techniques. I still remember those giant buzzsaws from
          episode one.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="LDAR">LDAR</h4>
        <p>
          But after the intro we open up on pirates! [Pirate noises] We&rsquo;re
          taken outside Somalia back on November 5th 2005, at 5:50 in the
          morning the ship Seabourn Spirit (today named Star Breeze) was
          attacked. The pirates attacked the ship both with RPG rockets and
          machine gun fire. Seabourn Spirit was not captured and the show
          thanked LRAD for this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          LRAD stands for Longe-range acoustic device and is a technology that
          can be used for many things. An acoustic hailing device, basically a
          long range megaphone. It can be used as a &ldquo;sonic weapon&rdquo;
          in quotations, we will talk about that some more in a bit. But also as
          an emergency broadcaster and to scare birds and other wildlife away
          from airport runways.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the show we focus on the sonic weapon part. In this mode we
          send a sonic wave toward a target, this beam is quite focused and can
          reach up to 160 decibels. But if you&rsquo;re some 40 degrees to its
          side the volume will be 40 decibels lower and if you stand right
          behind the volume is 60 decibels lower. So safer but not safe without
          hearing protections.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But yes, the Seabourn spirit did fend off the attack thanks to Michael
          Groves and Som Bahadur Gurung who with the LDAR and high pressure
          hoses fended off the pirates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of LDAR has today increased and with it also the criticism of
          it. Due to the high output it can create permanent hearing loss and
          damage in people in its way. But also to people in its vicinity, as I
          noted a moment ago just because you&rsquo;re not in its path it does
          not mean it&rsquo;s safe. So valid criticism has come up against the
          use of LDAR as crowd control.
        </p>
        <h4 id="battleofjericho">Battle of Jericho&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          But from here we make a hope and a skip over to the middle east and
          the city of Jericho. Or Tell es-Sultan as it&rsquo;s known today has
          been a site where people have lived for centuries. The Naftian culture
          did stay at the site back in 10 000 BCE, so there&rsquo;s a lot of
          history here. The walls were erected at the earliest during the
          Pre-pottery neolithic phase A and even this early the walls seems to
          have been up toward 3,6 meter (12 feet) high and 1,8 meter (6 feet)
          wide. There&rsquo;s a lot of interesting things we could spend our
          time talking about but you might have guessed that we&rsquo;re here
          due to the battle of Jericho.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show then goes on to retell the story about the battle of Jericho
          almost as it&rsquo;s presented in Joshua 6:1-22. We will in good
          Ancient Alien spirit hear this story a few times, Wilcock for one just
          repeat it with similar words but just agreeing with the narrator. They
          are though only focused on the ark and the ramshorn. But we then take
          a quick turn to a strange claim because the narrator says
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >according to scientists the walls fell due to an earthquake&rdquo;.
            So far I&rsquo;ve not been able to tell where this claim even comes
            from, could be just someone they asked &ldquo;what could have caused
            the walls to fall over</em
          >&rdquo;.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure the town did burn and was raised in the 1500 BCE and was
          abandoned until 900 BCE, but it was not an earthquake that caused
          this. More likely an army, but the walls seem to not have been pulled
          down flat here either. I assume it&rsquo;s a little thing to make
          their claims sound more likely.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we then have Jonathan Young come in and tell the story yet again
          to fill us up on some time retelling the story. And let&rsquo;s have a
          quick recap if you dear listener don&rsquo;t remember it either.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Then the Lord said to Joshua, &ldquo;See, I have delivered Jericho
            into your hands, along with its king and its fighting men. March
            around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six days.
            Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns in front of
            the ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with
            the priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long
            blast on the trumpets, have the whole army give a loud shout; then
            the wall of the city will collapse and the army will go up, everyone
            straight in.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So Joshua then goes and tells this to his people and follows the
          instructions as given. So when the day come on the seventh day it
          went:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted, and at the sound of
            the trumpet, when the men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed; so
            everyone charged straight in, and they took the city. They devoted
            the city to the Lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing
            in it&mdash;men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep and
            donkeys.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Note here that god told Johua to shout and blow the horns, one of them
          was not enough.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But after Jonathan Young's third retelling of the story David
          Childress came in asking
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >So, what kind of technology were they using? It sounds utterly
            fantastic to us that they could have had some kind of advanced alien
            technology. It&rsquo;s clearly what they&rsquo;re describing.</em
          >&rdquo;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To me it sounds as people following god's commands and due to follow
          them as told god tears down the walls instead of punishing the
          Isrealites. The book of Joshua isn&rsquo;t really to be taken as
          historical fact, historians and even religious scholars agree
          there&rsquo;s little of historical value here. The main idea with the
          book is to teach the importance of following the law in the book of
          Deuteronomy and the ten commandments. If you read the full book
          you&rsquo;ll notice the emphasis of obedience to god and the law. It
          came to be associated with Israeli nationalism later on of course but
          that was not the initial idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we get to meet a new face in the Ancient Alien world. Professor
          Tudor Parfitt (Jewish Studies, Univ. of London) who is making some
          strange claims for his speciality. But for having released a book
          called The Lost Ark of the Covenant two years earlier in which he
          claims to have found the ark of the covenant maybe explains a little
          bit more. I&rsquo;m also going to defend him a little here, in the
          book he does speak of the ark almost as a metaforic weapon. On page 42
          for example he wrote&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >This was strange, I thought, as I gazed out at night. The Ark at
            some level was the secret weapon of the ancient Israelites. It meted
            out death, yet it breathed life into everything. These properties
            seemed to carry a powerful mystical message.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          Parfitt claims that the Ark was/is stored at the Harare Museum of
          Human Science in Zimbabwe. Me and many others are skeptical and so far
          I&rsquo;ve not found that he has made a good scientific claim for it.
          But as with other things we will see and now when we have digressed a
          little let&rsquo;s continue with these walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          The show here mostly talks about the connection between LDAR, a sound
          being made and the walls falling down. Calling it extremely good
          evidence and&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about the battle of Jericho
            is that this particular use of the Shofar clearly seems to be the
            same thing that we&rsquo;re seeing with particle beam technology,
            death ray technology, thunderbolt technology. It very clearly seems
            that once again we have an extraterrestrial technology that the
            ancient people had at the ready that they could use when needed for
            military campaigns.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          When it&rsquo;s only used once in the bible and not again. Also I see
          a couple of issues firstly is that it does not really make sense that
          a sound would knock down walls. Sure, if you try hard enough you can
          break a glass that&rsquo;s close enough to a speaker with a 100
          decibel output. But you need to be quite close and loud. But since we
          don&rsquo;t have buildings collapsing during concerts or nightclubs
          with exploding drink glasses you can guess that it takes quite a lot
          to achieve this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we&rsquo;re also limited by living on earth where our pesky
          atmosphere prevents us from cranking the volume up to 11. So the
          theoretical maximum decibel is 192, can something be louder? Well
          sure, but then&nbsp; it stops being a sound and starts being a
          shockwave. Without extreme ear protection you would also have lost
          your hearing even standing behind the device.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But if the destruction would have happened it would have to be done
          with a blast or shockwave, but again we are talking about rather large
          forces that do not match with the description in the source. In the
          bible we learned that only the wall fell and the Isrealites killed the
          city by hand down to the last donkey.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then meet professor Taylor Wang who is also a new face for the
          series and Michel Dennin who both give a sciency sounding explanation.
          But it more or less boils down to if you have found the right
          frequency and have an apparatus you can feed unlimited power it would
          be possible to destroy the walls. But again we&rsquo;re left with a
          few what ifs and cherry picking. If the force is strong enough to
          bring down the walls it would destroy more of the town.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But we&rsquo;re going to leave Jericho and shofars to talk about
          something different. Would it be possible to move things with the help
          of sound? Could the ancient cultures have had access to levitation
          machines that used sound and could these help explain the mammoth
          stone structures that have &ldquo;baffled&rdquo; modern scientists for
          centuries (but not really)?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h3 id="soundconstruction">Sound Construction</h3>
        <h4 id="cyclopeanwall">Cyclopean walls</h4>
        <p>
          With this transition we&rsquo;re taken to the north eastern
          Peloponnese and the ancient city of Mycenae. Here the show starts to
          talk about the fortifications and the walls of this beautiful site.
          Mycenae should not be confused with the site with the same name on
          Crete and has been occupied since at least neolithic times.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The show will focus mainly on the wall but due to the long occupation
          period of the site we can expect that there&rsquo;s been quite some
          remodeling done on the site. The thing the show will focus on most is
          the &ldquo;Cyclopean walls&rdquo;. It is true that the site contains a
          style of architecture that&rsquo;s known as Cyclopean, the name comes
          from Pliny the Elder's book Natural History where Pliny claims the
          name comes from Aristoteles.&nbsp;

          The walls with this type of design were built in the Late Helladic III
          period around 1300 BCE. The design is most likely inspired from the
          Hittites, we have to remember that the world was not as isolated as
          the show wants us to believe. Or want us to believe when it fits them.
          But the mediterranean has for a long time had a tradition of trade and
          sailing, in connection to one of the palaces that have the Cyclopean
          architecture we&rsquo;ve found a scarab from Queen Tie who was the
          wife of Amenhotep III.
        </p>
        <p>
          But according to Pliny the name comes from the fact that the stone is
          too big for one man to lift. Therefore it might, according to Pliny
          who wrote this in 74 CE, been Cyclops who built this. The show of
          course latches on to this narrative and we will talk about it some
          more in just a moment.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But what really makes this type of architecture stand out is that
          it&rsquo;s rough and simple. The stones are not really dressed
          properly and gaps are filled in with smaller stones. Many of the
          stones in the walls are big, but not so big that a few people would be
          able to lift or move it. The walls here on Mycenae are made out of
          sandstone, this type of stone is quite easy to shape compared to other
          stones. So you don&rsquo;t need advanced tools to &ldquo;quarry&rdquo;
          them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s see what the alienists have to say here. So Coppens
          came in saying that the name is evidence that people back then knew
          that it&rsquo;s impossible for people to have built it. But with the
          same logic there must have been real trolls in Scandinavia who moved
          boulders around.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Philipp Coppens continues this claiming that the site is beyond the
          capabilities of the people who lived at the site. I&rsquo;m not sure
          when he thought this was built but I think we&rsquo;ve become quite
          accustomed to the show downplaying the capabilities of humans.
        </p>
        <h4 id="Treasury">Treasury of Atreus</h4>
        <p>
          They bring up the Treasury of Atreus or Tomb of Agamemnon as it was
          known in the past and the lintel above the entrance. There&rsquo;s a
          lot of things that&rsquo;s impressive about this tomb but I would not
          count the 250 ton lintel being the greatest of them. So this tholos or
          beehive tomb was built during the Bronze age somewhere around 1250
          BCE. So close to the building of cyclopean walls at least and again.
          We have moved bigger things already back then. But we continue with
          this quote:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;It is perfect. Just unbelievable. Now, we would have
            difficulties today moving that stuff around. Now, I&rsquo;m not
            saying that we today cannot do it. I&rsquo;m not saying that, but if
            we&rsquo;re struggling with our modern technology, is it really
            logical to suggest that our ancestors did this with pivots, and with
            little ropes, and with wooden rollers?&rdquo; - Giorgio A.
            Tsoukalos</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m sure that Tsoukalos would have issues moving a large stone
          alone but this is plainly a strawman. The heaviest object moved to
          date is Gullfaks C with an impressive weight of 1.5 million, yes
          million tons. If you think this was a one time fluke we moved a
          smaller platform called Troll A that weighs only 1.3 million tons. The
          Troll A was moved at 1 knot an hour, so really slow, by eight tow
          boats 200 km to position. But we&rsquo;ve moved a lot of things, maybe
          not fast but a lot easier and longer than previous cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I think it&rsquo;s good to bring up Wally Wallington that we
          talked about in the last episode with David Andersson. Wallington is
          the guy who built his own Stonehenge in his backyard, by himself only
          using gravity and fulcrums.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s move on, we have Michel Bara who agrees with this
          notion that moving heavy things are almost impossible. Our narrator
          then tries to move us toward their preferred explanation with the
          following quote:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;the key might be found not by studying the laws of physics, but
          by exploring the interdisciplinary science of acoustics and the
          principle of acoustic levitation.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <h4 id="acousticlevitation">Acoustic levitation</h4>
        <p>
          So the theory seems to be that they used some sort of acoustic
          levitation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Thomas Valone, who has a degree in engineering and physics, says that
          it&rsquo;s possible that the ancient people had access to levitation
          devices. But for full transparency I think it&rsquo;s good to mention
          that Valone is very active in the free energy movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          We then move to Taylor Wang again who I can&rsquo;t pin down in this
          episode. He has a good background and is an actual astronaut (they
          don&rsquo;t really bring this up in the episode). Wang was the first
          person of Chinese origin in space. I think we can put him in the same
          group as prof. Sara Seager, people who want to find alien life and
          were not aware of who they dealt with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Wang shows us an acoustic positioning device that can position a
          small 10g ball within the box with sound waves. Even with editing the
          background noise is quite loud and you can clearly see Dr. Wang has
          earplugs so this is not a quiet thing they show us here. From the
          looks of it we haven&rsquo;t got much further, from the look of it the
          machines might have gone quieter operating above the 20 000 hertz.
          People can&rsquo;t hear it but it's not very practical outdoors
          depending on the area. Something that&rsquo;s really clear is that the
          technology still doesn 't do more than drops of water and ping pong
          balls. It&rsquo;s cool but we&rsquo;re far from using this on a larger
          scale. The next step seems to be still to be able to use steel balls
          in the tests.
        </p>
        <h4 id="merlinbuilding">Merlin building Stonehenge</h4>
        <p>
          But armed with this knowledge that sound levitation might be real we
          go to Stonehenge. Why you might ask? Well since it&rsquo;s a myth that
          Merlin built the Stonehenge it must be true. So let&rsquo;s see what
          they have to say.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So our dear Georgio comes on the screen and tells us the story about
          how Merlin armed with a rod or magic wand moved these stones some 200
          miles to today's site. Ending this quite short story with that ancient
          myth is a bridge to understand what happened in our past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Michel Bara fills in that there's a number of these stories out there
          and all of them must come from a true source. He doesn't give any
          examples but hints that there&rsquo;s a lot of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let&rsquo;s have a little look at this. Georgio is right that
          there&rsquo;s a myth that Merlin built the Stonehenge. He does not
          precise which one he bases his retelling on so I choose to use the
          oldest and most spread version of this story. Note that there&rsquo;s
          more, but they are younger and some do involve Merlin making deals
          with the devil and things like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the today oldest and what has been the foundation for all the
          other retellings of the story can be found in Geoffrey of
          Monmouth&rsquo;s book The History of the Kings of Britain. This
          manuscript was written in 1136, but the copy I used was translated by
          Aaron Thompson and published by Cambridge in 1999.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          The story takes place before the famed King Arthur but his uncle King
          Ambrosium Aurelianus had tried to have a peace meeting with the
          Saxons. But even though no weapons were allowed those treacherous
          saxons hid some knives on them and then during the meeting started to
          attack. Aurelianus' men fought back and won the day. The king wanted a
          fitting monument went to Merlin for advice who replied
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;To honour the burying-place of these men with an everlasting
            monument, send for the Giant&rsquo;s Dance, which is in Killaraus, a
            mountain in Ireland. For there is a structure of stones there, which
            none of this age could raise, without a profound knowledge of the
            mechanical arts. They are stones of a vast magnitude and wonderful
            quality; and if they can be placed here, as they are there, round
            this spot of ground, they will stand forever.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          When he is met with laughter Merlin explains that the stones are from
          Africa and have special power. So Tsoukalos could have gone a bit
          further than the 200 miles if he wanted. But the Britons go to
          Ireland, fight some Irish knights and then it&rsquo;s time to move the
          stones. Merlin asks the army to try first and they try with ropes and
          force and can&rsquo;t get them down. After laughing a little bit
          Merlin:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;then began his own contrivances. When he had placed in order
            the engines that were necessary, he took down the stones with an
            incredible facility, and gave directions for carrying them to the
            ships&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>The stones then go back to England and</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Merlin obeyed the King&rsquo;s orders and put the stones up
            in a circle round the sepulchre, in exactly the same way as they had
            been arranged on Mount Killaraus in Ireland, thus proving that his
            artistry was worth more than any brute strength.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So the story isn&rsquo;t really about magic, sure it&rsquo;s in there
          but not really in regards to how Merlin moved the stones.
          There&rsquo;s no mention of magic, just ingenuitive. With creativity
          and brain he accomplished something that brute force could not. We
          even have depictions of Merlin building Stonehenge in a 14th century
          manuscript, if you look at the show notes you can see this picture. To
          be honest Geoffrey of Monmouthwas probably closer to the truth about
          Stonehenge than the Ancient Aliens crowd. Proving yet again that maybe
          we haven&rsquo;t become smarter, but maybe we do have become
          dumber.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright but how did they then move these stones? Michel Bara says that
          the stories he mentioned before involve people chanting so
          there&rsquo;s probably some sort of sound levitation. Because
          according to George Noory it would be almost impossible to do it by
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >They&rsquo;ve done experiments by putting hands around blocks. You
            can&rsquo;t get enough hands in there. You can&rsquo;t get 200,000
            hands to lift a block. And once you roll it with all these people,
            how do you move it?</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The sad reality here is that the blocks are closer to 32 km (20 miles)
          away. Analysis of the stone composition seems to indicate they
          originate from the area. 20 miles is still quite the walk but a lot
          easier. Do we know exactly how they moved the stones? No, not exactly
          but we&rsquo;ve brought up the Nias people that had a tradition of
          moving large blocks of stone as part of one of their rituals. We even
          have videos of this tradition and it is hard and requires a lot of
          people. But I have never understood the Ancient Alien position that
          the people could not have done this because it took time and required
          people. As if they found the ledgers and the ancient britts were
          runned as a predatory corporation with steep deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there was something they did have was time, especially Stonehenge.
          It was not a burial for a king or something that would have an end
          date.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we&rsquo;re going to round off this section of the show with a
          quote from Taylor Wang that I feel is a bit mined. As if he is
          humoring the producer, let me know what you think. Is he part of the
          alienist or not?
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Well, everything&rsquo;s possible. We have no way to rule in
            or rule out aliens, because human technology is very primitive at
            this stage. And you look at earth that has only&nbsp; survived four
            billion years, but there are planets billions and billions of years
            ahead of us. Their technology and their knowledge, it can be so far
            ahead of us, we can&rsquo;t even imagine.&rdquo;</em

        <h3 id="ancientantigravity">Ancient Antigravity</h3>
        <h4 id="flyingsaucer">Flying Saucers in ancient art&nbsp;</h4>
        <p>
          But we leave the island of Britain for this time and move on with a
          new topic. The narrator says that UFO:s are a modern invention
          according to the scholars. What scholars? Again that does not matter
          to the show. But they are right and they are wrong here. Unidentified
          flying objects have technically been reported since ever, if
          it&rsquo;s flying and can&rsquo;t be identified you have a UFO. The
          leap of connecting these things to aliens is rather modern. Many
          connect this to the reports from the pilot Kennet h Arnold who
          reportedly claim to have seen nine saucer-like aircrafts flying past
          his plane. This was in 1947, a good while after Orson Wells' dramatic
          reading of War of the worlds. But it&rsquo;s after this point the
          shape of the craft became saucerlike. We talked a little about this
          back in episode 9 with Blake Smith.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Now we&rsquo;re going to play the association game here while David
          Childress speaks about how UFO&rsquo;s have been depicted in ancient
          art. This is a common trope among the Ancient Alien people since art
          can be free and does not necessarily depict things exactly how they
          look. We don&rsquo;t think that Salvador Dali painted in an
          environment so hot that clocks melted like ice. Or if we look at
          Scandinavian petroglyphs that people went around with giant erections
          while plowing fields or fighting. Alright, we&rsquo;re not going to
          kinkshame on this podcast but I think you catch the drift.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we see a bunch of zoomed in petroglyphs, unfortunately I could not
          trace down all of them before the release but the hunt will continue.
          At the same time it does not matter, we see more from Tassil n'Ajjer
          and The Lascaux cave paintings, basically if it contains something
          round or strange they put it in the slide show.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&rsquo;re moving on talking about what they call summerian disks and
          claims that people are flying in them. But on the screen we see an
          Aramean queen with a servant on a funerary stela. The stela is dated
          to the 8th century BCE, today it can be found at Pergamon Museum in
          Berlin. But on this stele we see two people sitting and above them we
          see a winged disk with what looks like a flower. This winged disk is
          usually associated with the sun and more exactly royalty and features
          often within the mesopotanian civilizations.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But from mesopotamia we travel to Egypt where the show at 19:53 claims
          that there&rsquo;s another disk with wings. They seem to just ignore
          the huge scarab (or dung beetle) that&rsquo;s connected to the ball
          and well is the origin of the wings. As you might be familiar with, in
          the ancient Egyptian pantheon Ra was pictured to roll the sun across
          the sky. Similar to the beatle, therefore there&rsquo;s always been a
          special connection between the beetle and the dungball in Egyptian
          art.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s leave the middle east for some time, the show is about
          to take us on a new adventure and a new artifact we have not seen on
          this show before.
        </p>
        <h4 id="flyingturtle">Flying turtles of Guatemala</h4>
        <p>
          But let&rsquo;s talk about what I assume the show feels is one of the
          greatest pieces of evidence for flying saucers in ancient times. We
          are transported to Guatemala the narrator gives us a very brief
          background for Guatemala in general and then we start to talk about
          the object. This turns out to be a turtle. Or rather if we look closer
          we see that it seems to be a man who is emerging from the mouth of the
          turtle. At this point Georgio tells us:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;And when I asked the local archaeologist there, &ldquo;what
            is this?&rdquo; They said, without the flinching of an eye,
            &ldquo;well, this is, according to legend, the giant flying turtles
            &ldquo;which flew around in Guatemala.&rdquo; The entire body is
            aerodynamically fashioned. The extremities are pressed in an
            aerodynamic fashion against the body of this turtle. And if you look
            closely, it&rsquo;s as if there&rsquo;s some modern day fighter
            pilot glasses or goggles. This right here is from the same culture,
            from the same region where they created the turtle in Clay. So, they
            knew exactly what a turtle looked&nbsp; like. It looks like a
            snapping turtle. And what we have here is everything but a turtle.
            It&rsquo;s something else. In their frame of reference, they were
            able to use the turtle as the best example of what they might have
            seen that the gods used to fly around in.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So is this the smoking gun? The evidence for alien visitation as
          Georgio seems to claim? Well with Ancient Aliens is never as simple as
          you might expect and we are now fairly used to them having an artistic
          approach towards the truth. But remember what Georgio said because we
          will get back to this in just a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The place they talk about is called Topoxte and is located on a total
          of five islands in the Laguna Yaxha close to the more known site of
          Yaxha. As the crow flies there&rsquo;s only 27 km to the even more
          famous site of Tikal. Little is really known about Topoxte and so far
          there&rsquo;s not been that much research done on this site. So of
          course the Ancient Alien people use this to their advantage. Most of
          the construction of the site is located on three of the islands and it
          was founded toward the end of the middle Pre classic period.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So this turtle that Tsoukalos presented earlier, it looks rather
          strange and to be honest it looks new. It&rsquo;s definitely not
          ceramics but looks like wood in a very good condition for being
          excavated. If we turn to the article Tsoukalos wrote called &ldquo;<em
            >The giant flying turtles of Guatemala</em
          >&rdquo; published in the anthology, holy odin this is a long title,
          &ldquo;<em
            >The Disinformation Guide to Ancient Aliens, Lost Civilizations,
            Astonishing Archaeology, and Hidden History</em
          >&rdquo;. We will get a bit of a different story. The book was
          published in 200 5, so this is before he went on camera. But in the
          article he was asked to see the mechanic in a nearby town who had
          copies of some artifacts. So the mechanic shows him this turtle and
          tells Georgio about these flying turtles. Not an archeologist mind
          you, it also turns out that it&rsquo;s the mechanic who carved this
          replica. The original is supposed to be at an unnamed university at
          Guatemala City.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          To be precise he wrote &ldquo;<em
            >What does this represent?&rdquo; I asked the mechanic. Without
            raising an eyebrow, he said: &ldquo;This is a representation of the
            giant flying turtles in which the gods flew around, a long time
            ago.&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked. Without the slightest
            hesitation, he repeated what he had just said.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          He goes on in the article to present that: &ldquo;<em
            >Of course the critics now will say that the turtle is only meant to
            be looked at symbolically. The artisan used the turtle's shape to
            illustrate an important warrior's strength, who is invincible in
            combat because he is as strong as a turtle's indestructible shell. O
            r something like that.</em
          >&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          But is this true? Until we see at least a picture of the original
          I&rsquo;m not even sure if it exists in this shape or form. I find it
          off putting that the accounts of Georgios own experience differs in
          Georgios retelling of it.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But turtles are not uncommon in the Mayan tradition and they symbolize
          a number of different thin gs. We have for example depictions on how
          the maize deity comes out the back of a turtle. We also have
          depictions of Pauahtun (God N) who is emergens or wears a turtle
          shell. But the motif of people that emerges from the mouth is a common
          idea in maya art and religion. The motif of coming from a mouth
          symbolizes traveling across different spaces. This is maybe best seen
          on the murals at Yaxchilan. What exactly this turtle symbolizes is
          unfortunately hard to tell, it&rsquo;s not an all too common match but
          as you heard there&rsquo;s several viable explanations that would not
          include UFO:s. If we knew where the original was and more about its
          history and exactly where and in what context it was found we would be
          able to give a better explanation in time.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          From Guatemala we travel across the globe to the border towards India
          where a quite famous character will experience something
          otherworldly.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h4 id="alexanderufo">Alexander the Great's UFO battle</h4>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;Halfway around the world, in 329 BC, the Greek ruler
            Alexander the Great planned the invasion of India.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          So the date 329 BCE is a little weird but not impossible that
          Alexander was planning the next part of the campaign then. But the
          campaign lasted between 327-325 BCE.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But from here we go from a little weird to a lot more weird because
          David Childress is telling us that Alexander the Great's armies were
          attacked and dive bombed even before they got into India.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;As Alexander&rsquo;s army was getting ready to cross the
            Indus and invade India, suddenly in the sky appeared these flying
            discs. And they began dive-bombing at the war elephants that were
            part of Alexander&rsquo;s army. And what these flying discs did was
            cause stampedes within Alexander&rsquo;s own war elephants, who then
            ran amok throughout his army, tearing up the camps and everything.
            And after that, Alexander&rsquo;s generals met with him, and they
            said, &ldquo;no, we&rsquo;re not going into India. This is it.
            &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gonna turn back.&rdquo; And that was the end of
            that war campaign.&rdquo;</em
          >
          - David Childress
        </p>
        <p>
          So let&rsquo;s try to figure this one out since this differs quite a
          lot from what&rsquo;s written in the ancient sources I&rsquo;ve
          encountered about this campaign such as Plutarch's Lives of the Noble
          Greeks and Romans and Megasthenes Indika.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The claims seem to build on two accounts, the first is from Frank
          Edwards who in 1959 wrote in his book &ldquo;Stranger than
          fiction&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >He tells of two strange craft that divide repeatedly at his army
            until the war elephants, the men, and the horses all panicked and
            refused to cross the river where the incident occurred.What did the
            things look like? His historian describes them as great shining
            silvery shields, spitting fire around the rims... things that came
            from the skies and returned to the skies.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately Frank Edwards doesn't give any reference or source on
          this claim. But building on this Alberto Fenoglio wrote in the
          magazine Clypeus published 1966 that there&rsquo;s accounts of shields
          flying over the Maccedonian camps. But here we are not given any
          references either or what ancient sources that&rsquo;s
          used.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But looking into these it seems as Fenoglio is basing his writing on
          partly Edwards and the writer Quintus Curtius. The latter wrote about
          the Siege of Tyre in 332 BCE how the Tyrians used heated bronze
          shields filled with sand and excrement to sling it over the
          attackers.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But Frank Edwards claims the trace is a bit more unclear, but it could
          be possible some inspiration was drawn from Epistola Alexandri ad
          Aristotelem (Letter from Alexander to Aristoteles). The issue the re
          is that it&rsquo;s a known hoax, probably written sometime in the 4th
          or 5th century. But in there the author talks about a ball of fire
          flying over Alexander's army who take it as a bad omen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how about the silvery shields? Well it might have been a confusion
          for Edwards, during the campaign in India his troops changed name from
          Hypaspists to Argyraspides or the Silver shields. But unfortunately it
          seems as if the ancient sources are not describing UFO:s in connection
          to Alexander the Great's campaigns in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why did Alexander's troops revolt? Well, it was close to the river
          of Hyphasis and they had been out on campaign for a really long time.
          The prospect to maybe face larger armies to the west and not seeing an
          end for the campaign probably didn&rsquo;t help. Alexander's general
          Coenus is supposed to have said when hearing his commanders refusal to
          return &ldquo;longed to again see their parents, their wives and
          children, their homeland&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t need any aliens or
          UFOs to explain the armies longing to get home. I think this might be
          one of the most human feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Alexander we travel into our modern time where Stephen M. Greer
          and Childress are trying to explain how UFO:s fly and move around.
          Childress have apparently figured this out saying:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&nbsp;It&rsquo;s artificial gravity. So, when you&rsquo;re inside
            of a gravitational field that you&rsquo;re creating yourself around
            your craft, the gravity of the earth doesn&rsquo;t have a force on
            you.</em
          >
        </p>
        <h4 id="theneueraera">Artificial gravity / The Neueraera</h4>
        <p>
          We are a long way from creating artificial gravity, but there are
          small scale trials. I&rsquo;m not convinced that Childress explains
          gravity properly here. Gravity affects everything and earth gravity
          affects more than us. The moon for example, our gravity is responsible
          for the shape of our moon. The sun's gravity reaches and interferes
          with our planet. So that a UFO would create its own field that&rsquo;s
          unaffected by gravity around it sounds a bit much sci-fi novel. If we
          have any listener out there who knows more than me (don&rsquo;t think
          it&rsquo;s that impossible), please reach out and we can provide a
          better explanation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We then meet Paul Moller who presents his vehicle Neuera. The Nueara
          seems to be taken straight out of an episode of Jetson. To be honest I
          would not mind having one of those to fly around in. But if you hoped
          to be able to buy one it seems we&rsquo;re out of luck. Paul Mollers
          company seems to have had issues creating a craft that passed free
          flight tests. Today it seems to have gone dormant if not even bankrupt
          with a website that&rsquo;s not been updated since 2017.
        </p>
        <h3 id="bruteforce">BRUTE FORCE APPROACH</h3>
        <p>
          But from the quick and nimble antigravity UFO we move to Kennedy space
          station and we see the Endeavor take off. It&rsquo;s a massive amount
          of smoke and fire and we have Tsoukalos saying it&rsquo;s a truly
          magnificent sight and I can&rsquo;t say that I don&rsquo;t agree with
          this. But this period of agreement comes to a swift end when both
          Noory and Tsoukalos start to talk about people being on the moon in
          ancient times and that the gods always appear with a lot of fire and
          smoke.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So it seems as if we are going to talk about ancient rockets, on the
          screen we can see an artist's rendition of the lid from Pascal's tomb.
          If you would like to know more about the lid I&rsquo;d recommend that
          you listen to episode eleven where we talk a little more in depth
          about this.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What they say here basically boils down to ancient people not having
          the vocabulary to describe rockets or UFOs. Therefore they call the
          UFO and aliens gods and chariots. They claim that in all religions
          fire and smoke is always in connection to gods coming to earth. Steven
          Greer says:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re dealing with this subject and you look at
            the ancient literature, you have to look at it through the lens of
            how is it being experienced by a civilization with no foundation for
            understanding the science, the technology.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Meaning basically that if you decide it&rsquo;s an UFO before you read
          the ancient text they are a lot easier to find. We continue to bring
          up examples they have found of fire and smoke such as dragons in
          China. Tsoukalos repeated the Hung Di or the story of the Yellow
          emperor yet again. Still with the whole flare that HungDi came to
          earth in a dragon that he then stepped out from and then disappeared
          by entering back into a dragon. We have talked quite a bit about this
          in the past.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But from the Chinese dragons we go back to Greece. Michel Bara talks
          about how the gods in Greek mythology were traveling in chariots of
          fire. The only god who comes to mind is the chariot of Helios
          that&rsquo;s described as fiery, the rest of the gods seem to use
          ordinary chariots but with immortal horses.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>But from Greece we have Tsoukalos saying the following:</p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;In the Old Testament, we can read about a glowing furnace that
          descended from the sky. And sometimes this glowing furnace is
          described as a chariot of fire or as the glory of the Lord.&rdquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          The only mention of a furnace i n the bible is in relation to book of
          Daniel chapter 3 verse 8 to 25 that tell the story of when king
          Nebukanessar condemned three jews to death by burning in a hot
          furnace. But god protects the condemned persons and they can walk
          around in the furnace unhurt. This is another of those times where
          Georgio would need to provide the source for his claim for us to look
          further into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we&rsquo;re going to stay in the middle east but the show will
          present depictions of the sun god Shamash that can be found in the
          North-west palace of Nimrod.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          During this we have our beloved Von D&auml;niken talking about the
          Gilgamesh epic and that in there Gilgamesh travels up to the god Anu.
          During the flight it&rsquo;s supposed that Gilgamesh describes earth
          from above. A nice tale but yet again we&rsquo;re left without any
          references, going through the twelve tablets that make up the story I
          find a few mentions about Anu but not as described here. So on tablet
          one Anu hears the prayers of the inhabitants of the City of Uruk to
          save them from the horrible Gilgamesh, so Anu sends Enkidu. Then we
          don&rsquo;t really hear more from Anu until tablet six where Anu's
          daughter Ishtar comes to see her father because Gilgamesh refused her
          advances. So she wants daddy Anu to send down the Bull of
          heaven.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We see Anu again in tablet 7, telling Enkidu that he or Gilgamesh need
          to die for killing the previously mentioned bull. After this we
          don&rsquo;t really see Anu again. So as with the furnace, without any
          reference from Von D&auml;niken we can throw this story out too.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But being in Mesopotamia we can&rsquo;t leave Sitchin out of this so
          the show goes on talking about shem. You might be familiar with shem
          since it&rsquo;s one of Noah's sons but this is not the context here.
          So in the show Jason Martell claims that the ancient sumerians had a
          word called shem that was some sort of space capsule shaped as a pine
          cone. The priests, according to Martell, were entering this capsule to
          travel up and down to the gods.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But as you might suspect things are maybe not as they see. So the word
          shem is not sumerian, it is hebrew. But it has the same meaning as an
          akkadian word shumu that means &ldquo;name&rdquo; or
          &ldquo;renown&rdquo;. So the whole part here does not make sense, it
          seems as if Martell even got the pinecone wrong from Sitchin's
          &ldquo;<em>the 12 planet</em>&rdquo;. In there he attribe the word
          &ldquo;MU&rdquo; to a pinecone shaped object that rises straight up.
          No reference to a sumerian lexicon as you might suspect by now. But if
          you would pick up a lexicon made by the ancient mesopotamians you
          would realize that the word MU refers to the word &ldquo;SHAMU&rdquo;
          that would be translated to &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; or &ldquo;part of
          heaven&rdquo;.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Again something we can move down to the garbage pile. But let&rsquo;s
          just take a quick jump over to Greece where we now will discuss the
          Aeolipile. This is a sort of steam engine shaped as a wheel invented
          by the mathematician Hero according to the show.
        </p>
        <p>
          We get to meet John Robert Tindall founder of Tindall Vision
          Laboratories. He demonstrates a replica, so instead of pistons it has
          two exhausts that make the wheel spin as the water steam is pushed out
          of it. At one point the contraption almost explodes in Tindalls
          face.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          What is so fascinating about this? Well, according to Childress we
          don&rsquo;t know where Hero got the idea for this design and since
          it&rsquo;s not using pistons and are saucer shaped it must be out of
          this world. Did we mention that the contraption is named after the
          wind god Aeolus? if you have been paying attention we know that if
          it&rsquo;s a god involved we should read this as alien.
        </p>
        <p>
          But yes the contraption is named after the wind god Aeolus. But
          it&rsquo;s not really invented by Hero, it was noted down by Hero.
          Before him was Vitruvius, a roman architect and engineer. But both of
          these two draw this from Ctesibius (Tesibius), a Greek inventor who
          was working in the Ptolomeic Alexandria. Hero was the one who
          described it in such detail that we can reconstruct it. But the greek
          did have a lot of inventions involving engineering and steam among
          other things. If you&rsquo;re interested in these types of things you
          should if you happen to be in Athens one day go to the Museum of
          Ancient Greek Technology.
        </p>
        <h3 id="deathray">Archimedes&rsquo; Death Ray</h3>
        <p>
          May 2010 - Firing from a warship at a distance of nearly two miles, a
          ray of intense laser energy burns through targets traveling at speeds
          of more than 300 miles per hour. The test seems to have been on a 50
          000-watt with fiber optic lasers. I can&rsquo;t find that much info on
          it but it took place and today we seem to have more powerful lasers
          that would be able to intercept incoming drones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steven Greer thinks ancient people had access to death ray and with
          that we&rsquo;re moved back in time. More precisely to the year 214
          BCE and the Siege of Syracuse, yes we are going to talk about
          Archimedes death ray. You who might have paid some attention might
          think now that the siege of Syracuse was between 213-212. But
          that&rsquo;s Ancient Aliens for you and good catch!
        </p>
        <p>
          So the death ray of Archimedes is usually depicted as a single mirror,
          but most modern scholars seem to agree that it was more likely several
          of them if this contraption existed. If you want to find it you will
          have better luck using the term Archimedes heat ray instead of death.
          But it&rsquo;s been debated since the renaissance if this really
          existed or is part of fantasy. We don&rsquo;t have first hand sources
          of it and no great details on what they used.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          There&rsquo;s been many attempts to recreate the device in modern
          times.The most famous might be the TV-series mythbusters who tried
          this in episode 7 of season 4 in 2006. They deemed the myth being
          busted after having little success. The same year MIT attempted the
          same experiment using mirrors with success, the team argued that with
          a polished bronze shield the array would only need to be 1.5 times
          larger than what they used. So is it plausible at least that this was
          used? Seems as if it might have happened during the right conditions.
          But more research and discussion or even better hard evidence would be
          needed to put this question to rest.

          But from here we go into talking about the inspiration of such a
          device since the people during this time would not be capable of this.
          Childress even says &rdquo;<em
            >technology that would&rsquo;ve seemed like magic to our primitive
            ancestors</em
          >&rdquo;. But as we have discussed many times now, this type of
          thinking is quite insulting toward our ancestors. Remember that this
          event took place 212 BCE.&nbsp;

          Georgio goes on talking about the Indian Dorje, seemingly unaware of
          dorje being the Tibetan word for Varja. Sure they have similar meaning
          but using another language word to talk about the Indian version of it
          does not bode well for credibility. The Vajra is a ritual weapon among
          the hindu gods and&nbsp; has the properties of a diamond
          (indestructible) and a lightning bolt. But we use these semi mythical
          and mystical weapons to move over to Scotland where we will find the
          evidence for these being real.

        <h3 id="vittrifiedforts">Vittrified Forts</h3>
        <p>
          So across the Scottish countryside we have forts that seem to be
          vitrified. Almost like glass or glazed pottery according to the show.
          David Wilcock explain that
        </p>
        <p>
          &ldquo;<em
            >Here you have these stone buildings in which an analysis of the
            outside comes to the conclusion that they were heated to over a
            thousand degrees Celsius in temperature. Conventional fire could not
            have reached this heat. You needed a sustained burn at a thousand
            degrees Celsius for a long period of time.</em
          >&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So first of all, do these vitrified forts exist? The answer here is
          yes, there&rsquo;s about 60 of them known to date. Are they as the
          show describes? Well, here they have maybe had a bit of artistic
          license. So the stone for the most part looks like normal rock but
          embedded in tar or asphalt, sometimes you can see dripps in the
          blacker vitrification. But if you don&rsquo;t know what you're looking
          at I think that most people would not notice that it&rsquo;s something
          different here and write it off as normal stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we know they at least exist, not as glass or glazed ceramics but
          still they exist. But how about the temperature? Wilcock has a point
          that you need more than thousand degrees often, to be precise the
          process usually requires 1100 degrees celsius. Sound as a lot, but
          remember that this was in the Scottish iron age, maybe very late
          bronze age. So to melt bronze you need 900 degrees celsius, to melt
          iron you need something close to 1500 celsius. So we can state with
          confidence that they had the capability to vitrify stone if they
          wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were experiments back in 1934 and repeated in 1937 that you with
          common logs could vitrify the stone quite easily. They did note that
          they were not sure why you would want to do this but that it is
          possible. We still are not sure why they did this. It&rsquo;s not done
          everywhere and where it&rsquo;s done it is not done all over the wall.
          Sometimes it&rsquo;s inside, sometimes outside. Some patches here and
          some patches there. The explanation is probably more mundane than both
          we and the proponents of ancient aliens think. &lsquo;
        </p>
        <p>
          They use this to talk about the celtic god Lugh and how he had a spear
          that shot fire and what not. This part is similar to the other god
          sections we have covered so far and since they don&rsquo;t offer
          anything new or really that interesting here I&rsquo;ll just gloss it
          over. But the myths described are not evidence of celtic death rays
          that were used on the forts.
        </p>
        <p>But we end the episode on the following quote from Georgio</p>
        <p>
          <em
            >&ldquo;All these descriptions of sophisticated weaponry sounds
            almost like science fiction. But is it, really? Because we have
            those weapons today! And I think it is merely a reinvention of
            history; That all the stuff that we have today has been around
            before, and that our past is not science fiction, but science
            fact.&rdquo;</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          And seems to be so proud over that line. But we did not just watch
          science fact, no we did watch very poor science fiction.

          The intro music was created by Alexander Nakarada and from this
          episode we also have a fantastic outro. A band called Trallskruv will
          sing us out with their song &ldquo;tin foil hat&rdquo;. Links to both
          these artists will be found in the show notes.
