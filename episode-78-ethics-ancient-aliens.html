        <p>
          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine alternative history and ancient alien narratives in popular
          media. Do these ideas hold water to an archeologist, or are there
          better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 78, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we will talk about Ancient Alien but
          the focus will be more on how the supporters and believers use human
          remains online to support their idea. This is a bit of an extended
          version of the talk I presented at the Theoretical Archaeology Group
          meeting in Bournemouth this December. It was during a session on human
          remains in the online sphere in general. There were a lot of great
          talks and I’m a bit sad that not more of them are available online.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to thank all of you who support the show. You are really
          helping out producing this content, and I’m humbled and grateful for
          your support. If you want to help out, I’ll tell you how to do that
          and get some bonus stuff at the end of the episode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that you can find sources, resources, and reading suggestions
          on our website,

          >. There, you can also find contact info if you notice any mistakes or
          have any suggestions. And if you like the podcast, I would appreciate
          it if you left one of those fancy five-star reviews I've heard so much
          about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let’s dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          With regard to this topic and all its many sensitivities, where to
          start is a good question, a question best pondered with the bitter
          taste of a recently rediscovered cup of cold coffee. As Jack Kerouac
          once said, "But we lean forward to the next crazy venture beneath the
          skies." While the subject we're about to dive into may not be crazy,
          it certainly is unusual—and crucial. Ethics. Especially in archaeology
          and how it compares to the pseudohistorical use of human remains
          online. But before we get into the use of human remains in
          pseudohistorical places, we need to understand Ancient Aliens and the
          ideas of history. For those who have been lucky enough to have been
          spared from the Ancient Alien theory, let me ruin that for you. The
          main gist of this Ancient Alien Theory or Ancient Astronaut theory or,
          as professor Ken Feder calls it, "the horny spaceman theory." Is that
          human evolution, cultural development, and all of human history can
          only be understood if it was caused by a third party. In this case,
          it's E.T. who, instead of building a phone and going on a bike ride,
          creates humans and plays a part in our development. All knowledge,
          architecture, and societal advancements are given to us by alien
          beings with a vested interest in us. I'll get to why Prof. Feder calls
          it the horny spaceman theory in a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, one might wonder where this idea originated from. There
          are a couple to choose from, but a name is often left out of this
          discussion, and there's no one less than Carl Sagan. In 1963, he
          published a paper suggesting space-traveling aliens' existence. In the
          end, he implied that myths on Earth could be evidence of aliens
          visiting us. If Erich von Däniken was aware of this paper when he
          published his book "Chariots of the Gods" in 1968, is unknown. We know
          that building on the ideas of Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier—who
          drew significantly from the work of H.P. Lovecraft and the esoteric
          movements that emerged after World War II—Erich von Däniken promoted
          the notion that an alien civilization visited Earth and played a role
          in the creation of humanity and the development of our history. All
          human technology originates from an alien source, given to our
          "primitive" ancestors, as they call it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another big name within the movement is Zacharia Sitchin, who is maybe
          most known for his theory that alien beings came to Earth to mine gold
          since their atmosphere was out of it. Sitchins' evidence for this was
          Sumerian tablets, which he claimed to have been able to translate.
          There is, however, little evidence that Sitchin could even read
          cuneiform; experts have pointed out that the translations often
          contradict the dictionaries of the scribes of Sumer, Akkadia, and
          following cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          As so happens, the gold-digging aliens were either lazy or horny, and
          they started to experiment or mate with early hominids, creating
          humans as we are today. Through this, they could get a slave workforce
          for their mining operations. Depending on the author, there's also a
          hierarchy between the perceived races; von Däniken, for example, wrote
          in Chariots of the Gods, "Was the black race a failure and did the
          extraterrestrials change the genetic code by gene surgery and then
          program a white or a yellow race?" - Note the early use of "just
          asking question."
        </p>
        <p>
          While we could easily spend much more on Ancient Alien theory, in
          fact, the whole back catalog of this show has hours of it. In summary,
          it builds upon hyperdiffusion, anti-evolution, racism, and a colonial
          idea about our history. We will see these elements in how these
          Ancient Astronaut theorists use human remains online.
        </p>
        <h2>Mexican Aliens</h2>
        <p>
          Do you remember that in September last year, evidence of alien beings
          was presented to the Mexican government? As things turned out, it was
          not real aliens; it was just cake. Or was it? This is one of those
          rare cases where it would be great if viral videos online were true.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 2023, a journalist named Jaime Maussan presented what he
          claimed were two alien beings to the Mexican parliament. In the
          hearing, Maussan claimed these specimens had been tested by the
          National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, which could confirm
          these being Ancient Alien mummies. While it's correct that UNAM did a
          C14 analysis of a provided sample (LEMA Instituto de Física, 2023), it
          did not support Maussan's claim that the University confirmed it to be
          an alien life form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something left out from the original reporting is that Jaimie Maussan
          has been involved in several hoaxes, like the Metepec Creature, which
          turned out to be a shaved monkey (Romano, 2023). As we learned back in
          episode 38 and the Montauk monster. Identifying a creature that's
          supposed to have furr and no longer has can be surprisingly
          challenging. If you don't believe me, pause the podcast for a moment
          and google "shaved bear." Now, would your first suggestion if seeing
          that in the wild be that it's a bear? Probably not, or you might be
          way better at zoology than I am. I'm not an expert on that, so it
          might not be so difficult. This was followed up with the daemon fairy,
          which, according to Aja Romano (2023), consisted of a bat's remains,
          sticks, and epoxy glue. If you picture a daemon fairy made out of bat
          remains and glue, you probably are quite close to what Maussan
          created. He has been doing some weird hobby crafting at home, for
          sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2015, Maussan leveled up to using human remains, presenting a
          Peruvian mummy of a child as an alien being in a now private YouTube
          video from the Gaia channel. The abuse of remains of children is not a
          one-time occurrence in this story, unfortunately. We will also get to
          how these people get access to remains like this in a little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if the aliens were not cake nor extraterrestrial beings, what were
          they? According to Flavio Estrada, a forensic archaeologist who had
          the opportunity to study some of the Maussan mummies, they consist of
          human remains, animal bones, glue, and paper (El País, 2024). X-rays
          taken on some of these specimens confirm this. We see a mixture of
          different sets of bones, a monkey cranium, and phalanges facing the
          wrong direction (Sokolov, 2023). Bones, in general, are basically
          floating around and can quite easily be identified by someone with
          even a rudimentary understanding of the skeleton. This is not a very
          sophisticated creation by someone with expertise in autonomy. Still,
          Maussan has not been known for being a paragon of scientific rigor. Or
          even a good hoaxer, as seen in the previous examples.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while the aliens seemed to be some sort of crude papier-mache art
          project at first glance, the reality is much darker. Instead, we have
          smuggled remains from Peru mixed together with animals, glue, and
          paper. Maussans' source for the remains seems to be a man called
          Leandro Rivera, who admittedly smuggled some 200 remains (Garrison and
          Aquino, 2024).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ancient Alien people rarely regard remains as something worthy of
          dignity. To them, they are objects or artifacts rather than beings. On
          one of Giorgio Tsoukalos's profile pictures for one of those sites
          where you can get a personal video message we see Tsoukalos posing
          with an elongated skull in his hands. Here, we plainly see that it's
          not an individual but a prop. Geoffrey Scarre talks of approaching
          remains in a way that gives them dignity and preserves their
          self-respect. Applying the ideas of Kant to see how we can ethically
          approach remains while keeping their integrity intact. In the case of
          Tsoukalos posing with the remains, one can question if the integrity
          of the individual is intact. Another thing to consider is that Ancient
          alien theorists don't even view the remains as human. As we will see,
          some of these people claim that these elongated skulls are not humans
          but hybrids or even alien beings. So, not only is this person in the
          picture stripped of integrity but also their humanity.
        </p>
        <h2>Elongated skulls</h2>
        <p>
          Suppose you go online to places where alternative history ideas are
          shared. In that case, you will note that many of them, if showing
          human remains, show remains from Peru. This can be explained by the
          practice of artificial cranial deformation (or ACD), which we recently
          mentioned. A practice of the Paraquas and Nasza people. The elongated
          craniums of these people have been a staple in the social media
          postings of pseudo-scientists. Even if ACD can be found all over the
          globe, it is well understood and even practiced since 1900 in, for
          example, France, where it was called the Toulouse deformity. That many
          of the posts claiming to show alien remains are from Peru can be
          explained by the rampant smuggling.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all this is often ignored, and posts regarding the craniums are
          usually accompanied by claims of DNA tests showing that these are not
          humans. They are either alien or 50% alien. It's hard to claim that
          this is little other than dehumanization. When something is not human,
          it's easier not to apply an ethical reflection regarding the
          remains—not that we have seen such reflections among the
          pseudoscientific crowd so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          The claim regarding the DNA often seen in these posts is the work of
          Brien Foerster and later L.A. Marzulli. Brien Foerster is a sculptor
          and tour guide who has made a name for himself by promoting Ancient
          Aliens as part of South American and Egyptian history. In 2014, he
          managed to take samples from remains and had those sent to an
          unspecified lab. The sampling can be seen on YouTube and is quite is
          quite disturbing. In the video, we can see how people without adequate
          gear for DNA sampling destroy the mummy of a very young child. Dr.
          Jennifer Raff (2016), Carl Faegan (2018), and Keith
          Fitzpatrick-Matthews (2014) all point out that the results of the
          Foresters 2014 samples were contaminated, as shown by the data. Again,
          this is not strange due to the handling and lack of care when taking
          the samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remains were obtained from a private museum called the Juan
          Navarro Hierro Paracas Museum. We can see how they utilize these
          remains and Ancient Alien personas to market themselves on their
          social media. The museum has previously allowed the TV show Ancient
          Aliens to film parts of its episodes at its facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          A similar story seems to occur with Marzullis's tests. Dr. Raff (2016)
          points out that while a proper lab was used, the lab warned Marzulli
          that the samples showed signs of contamination. Something that did not
          hinder Marzullis from claiming the DNA was evidence of a
          Giant/European hybrid creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          This whole process, ranging from sampling without an ethical
          discussion to using bad samples as evidence, is highly unethical.
          Spreading it online without proper sources reinforces the idea that
          the human remains displayed are not human. They are something
          different.
        </p>
        <h2>Giants and AI</h2>
        <p>
          I want to continue on Marzullies' track here on Giants. They have this
          weird place in Ancient Alien lore and can sometimes refer to the fact
          that the aliens were large or that they created the giants in a lab.
          But if we go online, claims about giants being found are among the
          oldest and most common hoaxes we find online. In some cases, like
          Derek Olson, also known as Stargate Voyager, they just take a picture
          and hope you won't Google it. Mr. Olson posted some time ago about
          giants with a picture of human remains. It was cropped in the hope
          that you'd think it is a giant. However, the image was stolen from a
          Mirror article discussing a find in the Astrakhan Region of Russia
          (Best, 2019). The people discussed in the article were of average
          human height and not giants in any sense of the word.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other cases, we see old-school Photoshop or generative AI being
          used to promote these ideas. I can't help it, but I love these old
          pictures of giant skeletons excavated by photoshopped people. It's
          almost so bad it becomes good. However, we should not forget that the
          remains are still individuals we see and that these images contribute
          to the otherization of groups, often those of color.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have spent any time online lately, AI images have become a
          staple of the internet. Conspiracy theorists and alternative history
          promoters have, of course, seen the value of these tools and used them
          to flood us with manipulated images of a past that never was. Giants
          are a ubiquitous thing, of course, and without the need to know how to
          resize an image in Paint, you can have as many bad AI renderings of
          human remains as you like.
        </p>
        <p>
          Giants are also alternative history legends, among the oldest, and
          have been hoaxed since the 1800s. The San Diego Giant started
          appearing in papers around the turn of 1900 and can still be found in
          posts today online, portrayed as a real archaeological find.
        </p>
        <h2>The origins</h2>
        <p>
          These are just a few examples of how Ancient Alien pages and accounts
          use human remains online. It is worth noting that they did not invent
          this story or approach. Ancient aliens did precisely what we now see
          online, but for years, first in book form, then through the Ancient
          Alien TV series that's been going on for more than 18 seasons at this
          point. While it remains, luckily, it isn't displayed much on
          television. We see the same ideas as online when they are. For
          example, in an early show episode, we follow an author named David
          Childress to a museum to see hidden giant remains.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the clip, we see Childress lifting the remains of an Indigenous
          person by putting his thumbs in the eye socket. He then goes on to
          describe the cranium as being part of another species. Again, this
          demonstrates an act of dehumanizing the remains and objectifying them.
          We see similar tendencies when the show visits the Juan Navarro Hierro
          Paracas Museum, as we mentioned earlier.
        </p>
        <h2>In summary</h2>
        <p>
          The Ancient Astronaut theory is clearly not based in science. While
          archaeology has started to deal with its colonial roots
          (González-Ruibal, 2013) and discuss the ethics of research on human
          remains (de Tienda Palop and Currás, 2019; Scarre, 2003; Scarre, 2013;
          Sellevold, 2012), the alternative history crowd has gone the opposite
          way. They are continuing the colonial legacy and doubling down on
          things like hyperdiffusion. I'm not going to argue that Archaeology as
          a field is perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent example is when samples were taken from craniums stored at
          the Kon-Tiki Museum against the Norwegian ethics board's
          recommendations (NESH, 2018; Rasmussen and Viestad, 2021; Fugelsnes,
          2022). Raft enthusiast Thor Heyerdahl collected the remains on Rapa
          Nui between 1955 and 1956. As far as I can understand, these remains
          were collected with the approval of the Chilean government but not the
          local population of Rappanui. While this was not an uncommon practice
          back in the day, this is not how we should do things today. So when
          Norwegian professor Erik Thorsby applied to the Norwegian Ethics Board
          in 2017, they asked him to obtain permission from Rappanui before any
          samples could be taken. Unfortunately, Thorsby ignored the
          recommendations and proceeded to take the samples anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          There will always be those who prioritize their needs and careers over
          others. Of course, this is hard to prevent. However, as a field, we
          can discuss this and how, for example, remains should be displayed
          both in museums and online. There are guidelines and recommendations
          on how to use remains in press releases and online content on
          archaeology. We are interested in improving and dealing with complex
          questions as a discipline.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, the alternative history crowd is more interested in
          being perceived as doing science. Methodology and reflection are
          always in the backseat if practiced at all. For them, remains are
          objects that can be used to prove their story. Something we can
          clearly see in their presence online.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, what we see online—the "Mexican cake aliens," the
          reassembled mummies of Peru, the so-called giants conjured up from
          photoshopped or AI-generated images, and the elongated skulls miscast
          as half-alien hybrids—is not simply eccentric entertainment or
          harmless speculation. These spectacles, promoted by figures like Jaime
          Maussan or authors who claim DNA evidence from mishandled samples,
          reflect a deeper, more troubling pattern. They inherit a colonial
          legacy of hyperdiffusion and racism, casting non-European histories as
          primitive and dependent on mythical outsiders. They turn human remains
          into mere props, as if ancient ancestors were nothing more than puzzle
          pieces to be rearranged and glued together to support a preconceived
          narrative—one rooted in the belief that "primitive" peoples couldn't
          possibly have achieved cultural or technological feats without the
          meddling of "horny spacemen."
        </p>
        <p>
          This misuse of ancestral human remains, often taken without ethical
          reflection and displayed without dignity, serves a larger purpose: to
          validate a fantasy denying human cultures' complexity and autonomy.
          The pseudo-archaeological approach these fringe theorists take
          contrasts sharply with the self-examining field of archaeology, which
          continues to wrestle with its ethical breaches, such as the
          mishandling of the Rapa Nui skulls at the Kon-Tiki Museum. Where
          archaeologists strive to acknowledge past wrongs and foster
          responsible, respectful curation, alternative history proponents
          double down, producing content that dehumanizes the dead, disregards
          scientific standards and resists accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          By recognizing these patterns—by seeing how Erich von Däniken's racist
          "failures" of human evolution, Zacharia Sitchin's gold-mining
          extraterrestrials, and David Childress's casual handling of Indigenous
          crania all echo through today's AI-generated hoaxes—we can reject
          these exploitative fantasies. In doing so, we honor the lived
          experiences of our ancestors, protect cultural heritage from further
          misuse, and ensure that our understanding of the past is grounded not
          in spectacle but in integrity, empathy, and rigorous inquiry. In
          short, when we choose to respect the dignity of ancient peoples and
          resist cheap shortcuts to "alien" explanations, we reaffirm our
          commitment to a history that belongs to all of humanity—truthful,
          accountable, and worthy of our collective memory.
