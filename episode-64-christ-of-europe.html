          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in
          popular media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 64, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we are going to do something a
          little bit different. We will do a case study of a country where the
          government has started to promote its preferred historical narrative.
          While some might not call that alternative history or pseudo-history,
          I would argue that this is overlapping. So we will look at Poland and
          its memory laws, how the government is policing museums, and trying to
          silence research on Polish complicity in the Holocaust. We will also
          look at Polish history to see how it came to be and what national
          memory they draw from.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will look at how they create emotionally triggering museums while
          leaving out the parts of history that put Poland in a bad light. We
          will see how PiS, the ruling party, is trying to silence museum
          directors and professors who don't follow the party line. In the past,
          we have discussed how governments in Bosnia and Indonesia have used
          state funds to promote psuedoscience. This isn't too far off, just
          fewer aliens and lost civilizations. But it is still essential to keep
          our eyes on this pseudo-history in times like this. This may also be
          the first episode that might get me in serious legal trouble.

          On the third floor of a small museum in the little town of

            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Elbląg</span> </a
          >, we step into a wartorn landscape. In the background, we hear
          ominous music; a haze of bullets approaches us like warring messages
          of death. There's crying somewhere in the background, the sound of
          screeching metal echoing in the hall. In the first text, we meet as we
          step into this world of despair, goes as follows:

          We then move through history, where Poland is repeatedly the victim of
          aggression from its neighbors. The Vikings came and settled in Poland,
          as did the

          washed over the nation. The partition of Poland between Austria,
          Russia, and Prussia, the Napoleonic Wars, World War I, and, of course,
          World War II. While we meet a war-torn nation conquered by others, the
          Polish inhabitants are painted as victims. But while we have this
          notion of victimhood, the Polish people are portrayed as being
          prepared to die on their feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          But why are we talking about this? While it's fun to poke holes in the
          Ancient Alien theory and Atlantis claims, we must keep an eye on the
          alternative history that's kind of going under the radar. Alternative
          history has unfortunately snuck into politics, something we have seen
          in both

          and their state-sponsored pyramid hunts; there are more nefarious
          alternative histories that are being state-sponsored. Poland is an
          excellent example of this; they both have memory laws and a historical
          narrative set by the state. To fully understand all of this, we need
          to look at several things: Polish history, the history being promoted
          today, and the memory laws themselves. So, in front of us, we have a
          case study on how alternative history can be more than aliens and even
          worse. But let's get back into the history museum of Elblag.
        </p>
        <p>
          A floor down in the museum, we encounter another immersive exhibition.
          This time, we start the journey during World War II and get to
          experience life in Elbląg, how the Polish resistance was massacred and
          put in camps. We see apartments ravaged by German soldiers, and we get
          later to experience life under the thumb of the Soviets behind the
          iron curtains.

          The museum does an excellent job of immersing the visitor in a
          historical narrative. But if you lack a connection to Poland, you
          might get a whiff of rat here. You notice it a bit more clearly if you
          first start at the exhibition about the Viking settlement
          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truso">
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Truso</span>
          </a>
          or, as it is known today, Janów Pomorski. This exhibition offers texts
          and explanations in both Polish and English. But these two exhibitions
          I've told you about are solely in Polish. The target audience is the
          Polish adults and schoolchildren visiting the museum.

          This type of highly emotional history narrative is not some sort of
          isolated occurrence here in Elbląg. As Rūta Kazlauskaitė points out in
          a paper, this trend has been going on for almost 20 years. While some
          museums have gone for a more immersive experience, there are also
          examples of museums that are trying to have a middle route. One
          example of this is "<a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://muzeum1939.pl/en"

            > </a
          >" in Gdansk. While having a more, maybe not sterile, but traditional
          exhibition with artifacts and objects on display. There are also these
          immersive elements. You can walk down a street in 1941 where Jews are
          not allowed into stores. In another section of the museum, you walk
          through a bit of Gdansk bombed to pieces with tanks going straight
          through the smoldering ruins. What impressed me with this museum when
          visiting was the fact they told the story of

          I'll return to what we don't find in these museums a bit later. While
          the World War Museum in Gdansk is a bit more neutral, we still see
          this narrative of victimhood and isolation. A feeling that was
          enforced while we exited the museum.

          As you made your way out of the museum in the past, you were presented
          with a video. The video showed the experience of a fugitive in a
          modern warzone. It was a time to reflect on what you had witnessed at
          the museum and how those experiences can be found today in the war
          zones of Syria and Ukraine. Today, you are not able to see this
          particular video. Instead, a new film has been produced that is more
          in line with the ruling party's policy,

          historical policy. Named "<em>Niezwyciężeni</em>" or "The
          Unconquered," this video has, as Kazlauskaitė so well describes it:

            narrative and its associated emotional dynamics that the PiS
            government seeks to elicit among viewers.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          The video was produced by a company called IPNtv and did not work with
          a sparse budget. The animation itself is stunning, and the English
          version is narrated by no other than Boromir or Sean Bean, if you
          prefer. I'd like you to listen to the narration and pay attention to
          what ideas they promote because we will get back to these.

          The video is created to create a feeling with highly emotional
          language. The idea of Polish victimhood and abandonment is enforced
          through the video. Themes that are entirely woven into Polish history,
          as we will see. But note here that the video portrays everything in
          black and white; the poles are portrayed as heroic and rightful, while
          the others, the outsiders, are the only ones committing evil acts,
          either as the aggressors or the spectators.

          But where did this type of immersive museum concept start? To find the
          answer to this, we need to go to Warsaw back in 2004 and the grand
          opening of the
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.1944.pl/en/article/the-warsaw-rising-museum,4516.html"
          >
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Uprising Museum</span> </a
          >. The museum was a first of its kind and was created on the
          initiative of Lech Kaczyński from PiS. Visitors would be able to be
          submerged in the history and suffering of the Warsaw citizens during
          the Uprising that took place between the first of August and the
          second of October 1944. If you have the opportunity, you should
          definitely go and visit because it really is an experience. Since
          then, when PiS rose to power, the party has appointed museum directors
          that follow the party line, and we have seen how these types of
          exhibitions have become a large part of the Polish museum scene. All
          follow the party line regarding what version of history the public
          should be able to encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          This historic version PiS promotes is not only limited to museums but
          also popular media. This enforces the idea of the heroic poles, which
          are left to fend for themselves against the world, which either
          doesn't care or is out to harm them. On television, there are shows
          like "Czas honoru: Powstanie," or "Time for Honour: Uprising." A TV
          show following Polish youth fighting in the resistance during the
          Warsaw Uprising. Accompanied by songs like "<em
            >Dziewcyna z granatem,</em
          >" or in English, "Girls with grenades." All fitting within this
          preferred historical narration.

          To better understand where these ideas originate and to better
          understand Poland today, we need to have a quick look at the
          historical past. While we could easily spend a semester trying to
          cover the history of Poland to better understand the nation today,
          it's a bit out of the scope of this podcast. As we initially noted,
          Poland has had several occupations throughout its history. We will
          focus on a specific period during the 18th century when Poland was
          split into bits and handed to Russia, Germany, and Austria. Poland's
          participation seems to be where much of the Polish self-image
          originates.

          In 1569, a union between

          </a>
          was created in Lublin, creating the largest state in Europe. The
          Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth would last until 1795. How was such a
          large and robust country divvied up like a cake among siblings? We
          could spend hours on this subject, and as usual, you can find reading
          suggestions on the episode page. The SparkNotes version, however, is
          that leading up to 1772 and the first part of the Polish-Lithuanian
          Commonwealth, the country had been drained by endless wars with
          Sweden, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire. A large plague outbreak wiped
          out at least a quarter of the population, weakening the state even
          more. Add to this, the political structure of Poland-Lithuania. Some
          historians claim the state was a bit too democratic for its own good,
          and it's something that can be discussed. While Poland-Lithuania had a
          king as a ruler, the Sejm limited this power. A two-chambered
          parliament had the final say on the laws issued by the king and had
          the power to create rules and policies on their own. While this, to
          our modern ears, sounds very familiar and not really over-the-top
          democratic, each member of the Sejm had a
          <em>liberum veto</em>. The power of standing up and saying "Nie
          pozwalam" or "I don't allow this." In Sweden, we have a saying that
          when a meeting is unfruitful, and decisions can't be made, it is
          "Polsk riksdag," or "Polish government." The expression's origin is
          this veto right because if a member of the Szlachta nobility stood up
          and cried "nie pozwalam," the session ended and nullified the passed
          legislation made that day. Something that, of course, was taken
          advantage of by other countries who did not want Poland-Lithuania to
          make certain decisions or try to destabilize the country from the
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the position the Polish-Lithuanian found itself in. War after
          war with the surrounding powers, influence on the inside, and
          uprisings within the Commonwealth. For example, this led to the
          formation of the Confederation of Bar, a group of nobles who grouped
          together to defend against outside and inside threats, such as the
          Koliivshchyna rebellion in modern Ukraine, where Cossacks revolted
          against the unfair Polish-Lithuanian treatment of them. Culminating in
          a massacre of Polish nobility and Jews by peasants egged on by the
          Cossacks. The largest of these slaughters was the Massacre of Uman,
          where thousands lost their life. How many exactly isn't known; I've
          seen numbers from 2000 to 12,000. With maybe up to 100,000 during the
          Koliivshchyna rebellion.
        </p>
        <h2 id="settable">The table is set</h2>
        <p>
          The end of the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth is drawing close. There
          are three countries that will essentially use Poland-Lithuania as a
          buffet. To the east, we find Catherine the Great, who used power,
          money, and influence to get a man she thought loyal to her, Stanislaw
          August Poniatowski, in the position of king of the Commonwealth.
          Catherine hopes this will develop into this area, becoming a Russian
          satellite state.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the West, we have Frederick the Great of Prussia, hungry for access
          to the Baltic Sea. Frederick saw the weak Poland-Lithuanian state, and
          while licking his lips, he is said to have compared it to an artichoke
          he was going to devour leaf by leaf. Close by at the table sits Maria
          Theresa, empress of the Austrian Empire of the Habsburgs. She is
          pretty reluctant to agree with the idea of splitting Poland-Lithuania.
          Still, as the other rules put the napkins in their laps and pick up
          the cutlery, Maria Theresa joins in. Frederick the Great supposedly
          said about Maria Theresa, "the more she cries, the more she takes,"
          regarding her changing morality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stanislaw August Poniatowski, the king of Poland-Lithuania and
          Catherine the Great's supposed puppet, saw the writing on the wall. In
          an attempt to modernize Poland-Lithuania, Poniatowski started trying
          to get reforms in place. This alarmed the big three, who then decided
          to take what was in their mind theirs. Even if the Confederation of
          Bar had won some support among the Polish people for putting down the
          Koliivshchyna rebellion, the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth was too
          weak. Almost overnight, a third of the country's area was lost, and
          more than a third of the population was no longer part of the union.
        </p>
        <p>
          This shocked the surrounding nations, who rightfully questioned this
          brazen coupe. To make it seem legitimate, Austria, Prussia, and Russia
          forced the Sejm to agree with this partition. However, a young
          nobleman from today's Belarus named Tadeusz Rejtan tried to stop it.
          Dressed in the traditional noble robes of his class, with a sash for a
          sword and cavalry boots. He had a traditionally styled mustache and a
          shaved head, except for a bit of hair left on top, as nobles had
          previously done. He must have differed from the others at the Sejm,
          who supposedly had a more Western dress. Rejtan protested during the
          Sejm, but his voice fell on deaf ears. The others were bought by
          outside influence, or they had just given up. In the end, as the Sejm
          was on the way out, Rejtan threw himself on the doorstep, tearing his
          robes open and shouting, "kill me, stamp on me, but do not kill the
          fatherland."
        </p>
        <p>
          Does this sound familiar? While much of PiS's national history policy
          concerns 20th-century history, they draw inspiration from these
          events. Here, we can find a base for the views on Polish identity and
          how the ideal pole should behave in crisis. And who can blame them?
          This was more or less a blatant robbery in the middle of the day.
        </p>
        <h2 id="christofeurope">Christ of Europe</h2>
        <p>
          After this first partition, many Poles went into exile, some fighting
          in America against the British. Others stayed and started to work,
          trying to reform and stabilize what was left of Poland. Education
          policies and a new constitution were put in place. These reforms were
          not looked upon fondly by the surrounding countries. Soon, Prussia and
          Russia were hungry for more. In 1792, these two countries moved in and
          seized more land. An uprising was staged and led by Tadeusz
          Kosciuszko, who had fought in the American Revolution. This attempt to
          recapture the lands taken was unsuccessful; in 1795, there was a last
          partition between Austria, Prussia, and Russia. This would be the end
          of Poland-Lithuania during the coming 123 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is during this time we start to see Poland adopting an almost
          messianic identity of suffering. During and after the participation,
          there began to become an idea that Poland was the Christ of Europe.
          While traces of this idea can be found way back during the conflicts
          with the Ottoman Empire, the poet Adam Mickiewicz revitalized the
          idea. Mickiewicz wrote "<em>Polska Chrystusem narodów</em>" or Poland,
          the Chist of Europe. Incorporating the idea of victimhood into the
          Polish identity. It also reshapes the Polish identity from being one
          based on ethnicity to one of religion. With Catholic Poland torn apart
          and threatened by Protestants and Orthodox Christians, it's not
          strange that the focus shifted from ethnicity to religion. The
          Catholic church is still fundamental in Poland and a big part of the
          national identity. In early 2000, in a study by Ireneusz Krzemiński, a
          survey was performed, and 78% of those asked agreed that Poland has
          been the victim of injustice more than other nations. This number has
          been relatively steady, according to a 2019 IPSOS survey, where 74% of
          respondents agreed that Poland has faced more injustices.

          With this historical identity of victimhood, it's not strange that the
          populistic national-conservative PiS can use and abuse this to their
          advantage. We can see parallels between the teachings of WWII and
          Poland behind the Iron Curtain and the participation of
          Poland-Lithuania. An act nothing less than a daylight mugging in front
          of the rest of Europe who stood idly by. A crime justified by the
          18th-century xenophobic enlightenment ideals; as Larry Wolf put it,
          Poland and the Slavs are portrayed as backward and barbaric. People
          desperately need the helpful guiding hand of the more intellectual and
          benevolent West.

          So what's the harm, then? With a good understanding of Poland's past,
          let's see what this has led to. Let's return to the museums we talked
          about before. We're back in the immersive and emotional exhibitions
          and, walking around and experiencing history on both an emotional
          plane and fed with facts and information. But something is missing, to
          be honest, I believe that most visitors don't even realize it, when
          you walk down the exhibitions there is a story that's not told. The
          story is black and white. The Germans and the Russians are the enemy,
          the ones solely responsible for the slaughter. The Poles are the
          heroes and saviors, doing what nobody else dared to do and risking
          their own lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it makes for a good story, it's far from the truth. The reality
          is covered in more gray, something that the ruling party, PiS, has
          tried to solve by enacting

          >. While memory laws aren't necessarily bad, the Polish laws are
          written in a way that hinders scholarly research and academic
          discussion. Memory Laws have existed in Poland and other nations for
          some time. In 1998, the first version of "<em
            >Act on the Institute of National Remembrance</em
          >" was enacted in Poland. In short, this law made "<em

          2018, PiS added an addendum to the act, making it unlawful for a
          person to "<em
            >publicly and contrary to the facts attributes to the Polish Nation
            or to the Polish State responsibility or co-responsibility for Nazi

          At first, this law was sold as a way to stop people from referring to
          the Concentration camps built by Nazi Germany as Polish Death camps.

          and led by Nazi Germany.

          The reality is that while some did help Jews, others went the other
          way and participated in the Judenjagd, or the Jew Hunt. Poles would
          turn on the neighbors harboring Jews or partisans. In the 2016 book

          <em>,</em>" Jan Grabowski uses the rural area of Dąbrowa Tarnowska in
          southeast Poland as a case study. In it, we can look at the grey areas
          left out in the history written by PiS. There was a large amount of
          anti-semitic ideas and policies in place before Germany's invasion. As
          Grabowski points out, during the 1930s in Poland, the relations
          between the Jews and the Poles were deteriorating. Anti-Semitic ideas
          could be found in mainstream politics and the Catholic Church. In
          1936, then-prime minister Felicjan Sławoj-Składkowsk said in a speech
          to the Sejm that the people should financially boycott Jewish
          businesses. Just between 1932 and 1933, there is a vast number of
          reported cases of criminal cases with an anti-Jewish agenda. From
          vandalism to all-out riots, these cases get into the double digits
          just in a small Polish town.

          Grabowski goes on to quote Jewish-Polish Historian

          Emanuel Ringelblum went through a lot of trouble documenting life in
          the Getto of Warsaw and the refugees from Zbąszyn. Unfortunately, he
          was executed in 1944 after his hiding spot in Warsaw was disclosed to
          the Gestapo by a Polish collaborator.

          As we see, there was a great deal of Poles who actively and willingly
          participated in the German-instigated genocide of Jews in territories
          occupied by Nazi Germany. Luckily, or maybe unlucky, for the Polish
          self-image, Soviet Russia was also anti-Semitic. Something that led to
          these crimes against humanity was allowed to be swept under the rug
          when being behind the Iron Curtain. This image of the noble Polish
          citizen risking themself for the Jewish people would take quite a turn
          in 2001 when Jan Gross's book "<a

          In this small Polish town, there was a plaque put up commemorating the
          Jews who were killed in the city. Up until 2001, the plaque mentioned
          that these people were killed by Nazi soldiers. People passed that
          sign daily; many probably didn't know it was a lie. As it would turn
          out, at least 340 men, women, and children were killed by the Polish
          townsfolks. The highest estimate for the people killed is 1500. As Jan
          Gross writes on page 73 in his book, "<em
            >The massacre of Jedwabne Jews on July 10, 1941, was coordinated by
            the town's mayor, Marian Karolak. His name appears in virtually
            every deposition. He issued orders to others and was himself
            otherwise, more practically, engaged throughout the pogrom.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          While a station of 11 German Grenadiers was located in the area, it's
          hard to say if this was on their orders. While witnesses claim to have
          seen Mayor Korlak speak with the soldiers, nobody knows if they
          actually made this order. An anti-semitic spirit was present in the
          village even before the Nazi-German occupation. What we can say for
          sure is that this massacre would not have taken place without the
          German's consent. They could also have stopped it, but what we know
          for sure is that their involvement seems to have been limited to
          taking a few pictures. We don't know if the Jews of Jedwabne would
          have been spared if Poland had not been invaded. Prognoms were taking
          place after the war, such as the Kielce massacre, where 42 Jews were
          killed by Polish people. Hundreds of Jews were killed after the war by
          Polish Nationalists. Jedwabne might have followed in these steps after
          the war. But what we do know is that on the 10th of July in 1941, the
          townsfolk in Jedwabne raped, mutilated, murdered, and looted their
          Jewish Neighbors. Not on direct orders from the Nazi occupiers but
          from the mayor of their town.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the news of this came, many doubted it to be true. These people
          are still around today. Even the new monument that was put up leaves
          room for deniability. On it, we can read "<em
            >To the Memory of Jews from Jedwabne and the Surrounding Area, Men,
            Women, and Children, Co-inhabitants of this Land, Who Were Murdered
            and Burned Alive on This Spot on July 10, 1941.</em

          But it's good that Poland is starting to deal with this, right? Well,
          here is the thing. I'm not sure if this would be research possible in
          Poland today. With the 2018 law, the Polish government can't be
          accused of complicity. This stretches down to local city councils, as
          two respected history professors, Jan Grabowski and Barbara Engelking,
          learned in 2021 when they were put on trial for breaking the 2018 law.
          The trial was based on a vitness account that Engelking published in a
          chapter of the 2018 book "<em
            >Dalej Jest Noc. Losy Żydów w Wybranych Powiatach Okupowanej

          In this account, we follow Estera Drogicka, who was helped by the
          sołty, or the head of the village of Malinowa, Edward Malinowski. A
          little Polish word lesson here, the word malinowa translates to
          raspberries. In this account, we see the duality of humans. While
          Malinowski, according to this account, did seem to help Jews escape,
          even if he seems to have been charged for it, he also reported some
          who were in hiding to the authorities. Something that's often repeated
          is that the Germans would punish those who hid Jews with death. That's
          not the case; while some who hid people certainly were executed, many
          others just got served fines.

            family, armed with documents purchased from a Belarusian woman,
            decided to leave for Prussia to work. The village head (Schultheiß
            or Sołtys) of Malinowa, Edward Malinowski, helped her with this
            (robbing her in the process) — and in December 1942, she ended up in
            Rastenburg (Kętrzyn) as a domestic helper in the German Fittkau
            family. Not only did she meet her second husband there (another Pole
            working there), but she also developed a trade business, sending
            packages of goods for sale to Malinowski. She visited him when she
            went on vacation "home." She was aware that he was complicit in the
            deaths of several dozen Jews who were hiding in the forest and were
            handed over to the Germans. Despite this, during his post-war trial,
            she gave false testimony in his defense.</em

          The authors have thoroughly documented and accounted for all the
          sources in their book, providing a comprehensive list of references.
          Yet, the 2018 law has opened up for researchers to be dragged into
          court by people who don't like their findings. The law, however, makes
          it a civil matter, but the nationalistic right-wing organization

          lawsuits. For example, we just heard about the one. They even got
          Malinowski's niece, Filomena Leszczyńska, involved. In later
          interviews, she commented, "<em
            >This book is intended to keep us crawling. Accuse uf of
            anti-Semitism, of collaboration with the Germans, of the worst

            >The machinery of the Polish state is engaged in the suppression of
            independent research," Grabowski told me. State-employed researchers
            have been "looking at each and every footnote to see if we made a
            mistake" in "Night Without End," he said. The book has more than
            thirty-five hundred footnotes.</em

        </p>
        <p>
          Jan Gross, whom we mentioned earlier, was also subjugated to
          investigations and hour-long interrogations by the government. This
          was after he made a comment that the Polish people in occupied Poland
          probably killed more Jews than they killed Nazis. The president even
          threatened to take away an award Gross got in 1996. PiS also had the
          museum director of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.polin.pl/en">
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Warsaw's Polin</span> </a
          >, a museum about the Polish Jews, Dariusz Stola, ousted from his
          position. What led to this was an exhibition that the museum put up
          about the Anti-Zionist campaigns and purges of Jews that happened in
          March 1968 as a response to the political crisis taking place. At the
          end of the exhibitions were anonymous anti-Jewish quotes from 1968 and
          modern times. Still, some of these could be recognized as belonging to
          members of the PiS party.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investigation of Jan Gross was dropped when he retired from
          Princeton. While Jan Grabowski and Barbara Engelking were initially
          convicted, an appeals court later overturned the ruling. Judge Joanna
          Wiśniewska-Sadomska declared in the ruling that "the courtroom was not
          the right place for a historical debate." However, the verdict still
          had effects; for example, the section about Malinowski was removed
          from the English translation. Also, who knows what will happen the
          next time something similar goes to court?
        </p>
        <p>
          This little case study of Poland shows the dangers of a government
          trying to control the historical narrative. While some might not agree
          with my assessment that this is a sort of alternative history
          narrative, I stand by this claim. At the bare minimum, we can all
          agree that this is a distortion of history. We also have, in the past,
          covered how nationalistic governments have sponsored
          pseudoarchaeological projects in Bosnia and Indonesia; this is just a
          maybe even more dangerous version of this.
