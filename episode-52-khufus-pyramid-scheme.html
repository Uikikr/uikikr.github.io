          This time, we are going to look at the top 10 pyramids of the world
          according to Ancient Aliens. I could not tell if the list is based on
          how significant evidence the pyramids are for extraterrestrial
          visitation or how cool they are. The episode would also become too
          long if we did the whole list simultaneously, so this will be a
          two-parter. You could also view it as a compilation episode of some
          great pyramids and one farm structure. We will spend most of our time
          in Mesoamerica and visit Peru and Greece. I think you'll really love
          this episode; we will even have a case where the Ancient Astronaut
          believers cite their sources, a real Christmas miracle here.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Digging up Ancient Aliens, our host Fredrik uses his background in
          archaeology to discover what is genuine, fake, and somewhere in
          between in popular media, such as Ancient Aliens, Ancient Apocalypse,
          and many other places.

          Hi, hello, and v√§lkommen to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the
          podcast where we examine strange claims about alternative history and
          ancient aliens in popular media. Do their claims hold water to an
          archeologist, or are there better explanations out there?
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 52, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. This time, we are going to look at the top 10
          pyramids of the world according to Ancient Aliens. I could not tell if
          the list is based on how significant evidence the pyramids are for
          extraterrestrial visitation or how cool they are. The episode would
          also become too long if we did the whole list simultaneously, so this
          will be a two-parter. You could also view it as a compilation episode
          of some great pyramids and one farm structure. We will spend most of
          our time in Mesoamerica and visit Peru and Greece. I think you'll
          really love this episode; we will even have a case where the Ancient
          Astronaut believers cite their sources, a real Christmas miracle here.

          And if you like the podcast but can't spend much time after Christmas
          and the holidays, a five-star review and telling a few friends are
          great ways to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we have finished our preparations, let's dig into the
          episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="castillo">El Castillo</h2>
        <figure class="rounded">
          <img
            src="img/pexels-omar-zetina-12046436 (1).jpg"
            class="img-fluid"
            alt="picture of El Castillo in Chichen Itza"
          />
          <figcaption class="figure-caption">
            <p>El Castillo in Chichen Itza</p>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          We start this list with a familiar location we have visited several
          times. El Castillo in Chich√©n Itz√° is number 10 on this list, and we
          have been here both with Ancient Aliens and Graham Hancock. Clearly,
          it is an exciting pyramid, and what's more interesting is that it lets
          us compare a little between the Ancient Alien narrative and Graham
          Hancocks. So what are the Alienists saying about the site this time?
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >El Castillo was built to venerate the Mayan god known as Kukulkan,
            or the "Feathered Serpent." There were traditions in ancient Mexico
            of a great teacher arriving on the Gulf Coast. He was said to be
            Kukulkan, which translates as "the plumed or feathered serpent," and
            when he arrived, he brought with him the arts of civilization. He
            taught astronomy, he created the first calendar, he also taught
            agriculture, and eventually, he left, promising to return. And he
            was often depicted as a human being as well.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Last time we were here, they focused more on the human sacrifice at
          the site, but this time, we hear nothing of this. Instead, we get the
          narrative of K'uk'ulkan, which is very similar to the story we heard
          from Hancock in Ancient Apocalypse. This episode was released well
          after the Netflix series, so there might be some inspiration here
          because this part's alien narrative is strangely quiet. So, let's
          again dissect the K'uk'ulkan or Quetzaquatl narrative and the pyramid
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chich√©n Itz√° is located within the center of the Yucut√°n with the Gulf
          of Mexico to the north. To describe it as a landlocked city is a bit
          of an understatement. An exciting aspect of Chich√©n Itz√° is that it
          has had several different cultures and groups over its relatively
          short inhabitation. We see an apparent Maya influence in the early
          cities with buildings made in Puuc-style architecture. Puuc
          architecture was used at Uxmal and other ancient Maya sites, featuring
          stone veneers over a concrete core. Buildings had a plain lower facade
          with rectangular blocks and doorways, while the upper facade was
          richly decorated with intricate stone mosaics. The earliest estimated
          date for the first inhabitation of the area is in 550 CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the buildings in the Maya style seem to have been erected
          during the 800s CE, and the first secure date is from a Puuc-style
          building called Chichanchob or Casa Rojo. This building, which was
          still covered in red paint when discovered, has a Mayan inscription
          referencing the years 869 and 870 CE in combination with several
          lords' names and a reference to bloodletting ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, Chich√©n Itz√° was not a monoculture, and we see Itza's influence
          and culture at the site. This would then be exchanged for Toltec
          influence, a culture from Central Mexico not far from Mexico City.
          This is quite evident when we look closer at the El Castillo pyramid,
          where what we see today is the last installment of construction that
          took place during the influence of the Toltecs. As with other
          buildings and pyramids in Mesoamerica, this one seems to have several
          substructures. One was discovered during the 1930s when two tunnels
          were excavated into the pyramid. Inside, we find a stepped pyramid in
          Pure Florescent style or Puuc style. It has nine platforms
          superimposed on each other and only one staircase on the northern
          side. Around the top entrance, we can also see a later style called
          the modified Florescent style found in places such as Tenochtitlan.
          Inside the building, there was found in two separate chambers,
          according to Ringle, "<em
            >a chacmool statue and a jade-inlaid jaguar throne, on which an
            offering of back mirrors was placed. Although these may well
            postdate construction of the sub, they do indicate use of the
            structure after such traits had been introduced.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2018, a paper was published by Tejero-Andrade <em>et al</em>., who,
          with the help of ERT geophysical surveys, showed that there seems to
          be an earlier building beneath this substructure. This was based on
          previous attempts using ERT-3D in 2015 to find substructures within El
          Castillo. They could also see an additional building on top of the
          known substructure. This new method of scanning the soil for
          structures could be helpful when deciding on further excavations or
          research on the temple with minimal unnecessary damage to the
          structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          El Castillo may be best known for the shadow phenomenon that occurs
          twice a year. During that period, a shadow is cast on the serpent that
          follows one of the staircases, making it look like it descending or
          ascending. This was first noticed in 1928; the first photos of the
          phenomenon were taken in 1948. In Ancient Aliens and Ancient
          Apocalypse, the event dates are the 23rd of March and the 21st of
          September. But before you run and buy airplane tickets, you should be
          aware that it's not a fixed event; according to Boot, the event
          usually takes place between 14-30 March and 15-30 September. Boot's
          observations during 2001 showed that the shadow was visible on the
          22nd, 26th, and 27th of March. A question that's still not wholly
          answered is if this shadow was intentional and observed by the
          inhabitants of Chich√©n Itz√°. While authors like Boot find it likely
          that it was intended, others are not as sure due to the lack of
          writing about it. I'm sure that the inhabitants noticed this effect.
          Still, as others point out, no ritual is yet associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, I'd like to return to the K'uk'ulkan discussion because Ancient
          Aliens make the same mistake as Hancock does when discussing this
          diety. The difference is that according to the alien proponents,
          K'uk'ulkan or Quetzalcoatl are alien beings. At the same time, Hancock
          claims they are white-bearded Atlanteans. Unfortunately, they are both
          quite far from the truth since they don't understand the history and
          concepts of this diety and that this name can refer to several
          different concepts. Gr√ºnschlo√ü has identified five separate uses the
          pseudo-scientific crowd has melted into one. They are as follows:
          quote.
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >(1) the theriomorphic representation as a feathered (celestial)
            serpent, which is the oldest in terms of religious history and
            iconography,</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >(2) the anthropomorphic conception of the deity Quetzalcoatl with
            specific attributes or insignia, but as such also.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >(3) fluidly transforming into the wind deity "Ehecatl," with other
            characteristic attributes,</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >(4) as well as the purely human figure of the mythical-legendary'
            priest prince' Ce Acatl Topiltzin "Quetzalcoatl" with his alleged
            sphere of action in Tollan or Cholula, and</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >(5) the designation "Quetzalcoatl" as sovereign title for certain
            priestly dignitaries /.../.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Gr√ºnschlo√ü also notes that these accounts also often include the
          narrative from the Seri people, a tribe separate from the Mesoamerican
          language and culture located in the northwest of Mexico. However, they
          have a culture bringer, Ahnt ah Koh' mah, or in English, "He who
          brings Fires." Note that, in this case, the hero comes from the East.
          Anyway, it becomes clear that these alternative historians and ancient
          alien proponents haven't done their homework. When we speak about both
          Quetzalcoatl, the Aztec name, and K'uk'ulkan, the Maya and Tzotil
          name. The translations turn out the same, however. K'uk can be
          translated to Quetzal, the green and red bird, while '<em>kan</em>' is
          translated to serpent. The exact translation can be used for the
          N√°huatl version (or Aztec version). The root for the first part is
          '<em>quetzalli,'</em> or Quetzal bird, and '<em>coatl'</em> is
          generally accepted to be translated as a serpent. It's important to
          note, as Gr√ºnschlo√ü points out, that it can refer to different things.
          We can talk about the literal god, or in some cases, kings or priests
          who are not gods but have the same name. Let's look at one of these
          examples occurring within Chich√©n Itz√°.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Books of Chilam Balam are handwritten manuscripts created by the
          Maya to preserve their history and culture in the 17th and 18th
          centuries. One of the sections in some of these texts is known as the
          "k'atun prophecies." Two of the manuscripts, Chumayel and Tizim√≠n, are
          named after the towns where they originated. Reading the Chumayel
          k'atun prophecy, we find the following passage, translated by Eric
          Boot.
        </p>
        <p>"<em>4 Ahaw is the k'atun.</em></p>
        <p>
          <em>It is the eleventh part of the k'atun</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>to be counted. Chich√©n</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Itz√° is the seat of the k'atun.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Arrive will the settlement of the</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Itz√°. Arrive will</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>the Quetzal, arrive will the</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>cotinga, arrive will Ah</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>K'ante'nal, arrive will</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>vomit of blood. Arrive will</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >K'uk'ulk√°n, after them for a second time. It is the word of
            God,</em
          >
        </p>
        <p><em>that is. Arrive will the Itz√°.</em>"</p>
        <p>
          In this text, it's not really the god they are talking about but a
          leader of a Warband that takes over Chich√©n Itz√°. A similar passage
          can be found in the Tizim√≠n Chilam Balam, but the city is not
          specified in that version. Reading other accounts, it becomes clear
          that K'uk'ulkan sometimes refers to a ruler or a priest. In some
          cases, this ruler arrives with their brothers, and in some cases, a
          small warband. But there's nothing special about these characters
          besides that they are great at conquest. K'uk'ulkan is not described
          as being white, arriving from the sky, or those things. In these
          accounts, they are humans and behave as we expect humans to. Suppose
          you want to learn more and go deeper into this subject. In that case,
          Eric Boot offers a magnificent deep-dive into this in his book "<em
            >Continuity and Change in Text and Image at Chich√©n Itz√°.</em
          >" There, Boot follows the character through all the available sources
          and helps us understand how it fits within the mixed society of
          Chich√©n Itz√°. I hope you get out of this short summary that the
          Ancient Alien proponents mixed several separate stories into one
          narrative. But suppose we split this narrative into the different
          characters that the Mayans and Aztecs described. In that case, nothing
          of what they say holds up. K'uk'ulkan nor Quetzalcoatl were culture
          bringers in these cultures; that idea is taken from a separate culture
          nearby.

          With all this covered, we will head to their number nine on the list.

          Number nine on the list doesn't take us too far away. Just a hop and a
          skip to Teotihuacan. A place we also visited in the past looking for
          mica in episode 29, "Aliens and Ancient Engineers," and looked into
          the claims about Teotihuacan lined up with Orion belts. As I mentioned
          in that episode, it is only accurate if we rearrange the site's
          designs. This is something that Bauval and Hancock left out in their
          book "The Message of the Sphinx." While the Orions Belt theory is
          brought up again here, the mica claims are strangely not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teotihuacan is a fantastic place, far more significant than one might
          imagine initially. I was there many years ago, and the size of the
          pyramids and being able to go up is an experience. The site history is
          unfortunately quite understudied, but it seems as if people started to
          abandon the villages on the hillside in the Mexico Valley and settle
          on the valley floor. The earliest date this happened is during the
          Late Cuanalan phase, meaning somewhere between 600 to 200 BCE. The
          reason is most likely due to better agricultural settings on the
          valley floor than the hills. The first known public structure is the
          "Pyramid of the Moon," whose construction started during the
          Patlachique phase. While no exact date has yet been established, it is
          usually agreed to be between 100 and 1 BCE. Note that this was not an
          entire pyramid but a smaller platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is much left to explore at the site, and excavations reveal new
          things here. For example, we might have to revise the construction of
          the Pyramid of the Sun. Excavations between 2008 and 2011 inside the
          pyramid have given a lot of ceramic fill and new C14 datings. Based on
          analysis of some 30,000 ceramic pieces, found as filling inside the
          pyramid, and C14 dates, the construction date might have been 229‚Äì330
          CE. Sugiyama and a larger team discovered earlier buildings and
          burials inside the pyramid. But as Deborah Nichols points out, it's a
          bit too early to revise the chronology yet. But amazing discoveries
          are taking place, and real history is being revealed here.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its peak, the settlement was one of the Mesoamerican world's
          largest and most powerful places. Something that would change as with
          all powerhouses. Signs of struggle started around 500 CE with problems
          in Teotihuacan outer borders; this would increase until the fiery
          destruction of the street of the dead and the public buildings. For a
          long time, the date has usually been suggested to be around 750 CE;
          recent studies indicate that this event could have occurred almost 200
          years earlier. Interstingly, this destruction only affects the public
          buildings and the central part of Teotihuacan. With this destruction,
          the city was only briefly abandoned, but shortly after, people started
          to return and resettle the city. While it never returned to the good
          old days of being the biggest, it had a continuous settlement through
          the Epiclassic period. This period is 600-900 CE. During the
          post-classic 900-1150 CE, the population was between 30,000 and 20,000
          people. While this is far from the population of the big dog days,
          it's not a tiny village size either. During the middle post-classic,
          1150‚Äì1350 CE, Teotihuacan had again become the capital of a small
          city-state. Although the population never exceeded 10,000 during this
          period, it became a substantial place for the Aztecs.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Sweden, we say that a loved child has many names, which is quite
          true regarding Teotihuacan. Dr. Edwin Barnhart says the name
          translates to "birthplace of the gods." However, this is just one of
          many translations you'll see if you start to read about this. I've
          also seen it translated to "place where gods were born," "place of
          those who have the road of the god," "the place where gods were
          created," "The City of the Gods," "place where time where created,"
          and "the place where men become gods." While many of these
          translations are similar, they get slightly different meanings
          depending on which one you use. Before we go further down this rabbit
          hole, something worth noting is that the word originates from the
          Nahuatl language; this is the Aztec name for the site. We currently
          don't know the original inhabitants' names for the location, and it
          seems we might have gotten Teotihuacan wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veronica Ortega from Mexico's<em>
            National Institute of Anthropology and History</em
          >
          and Edith Vergara and Enrique del Castillo suggest an alternate name
          for the city based on the re-examination of the Xolotl codices. This
          is one of the earliest documents we have from the Valley of Mexico,
          and on plate 6 and quadrant 1C, we can find a glyph that looks like a
          pyramid with a setting sun behind it. This is generally accepted to
          refer to Teotihuacan, but beneath this glyph is written Teo-huacan or
          "city of the sun." As Ortega points out, we also see pyramids and a
          sun in the Codex of Huamantla when referring to Teotihuacan. Stela 31
          in Tikal could also confirm this; Ortega claims that the City of the
          Sun is written on this stela and refers to Teotihuacan. Wort points
          out that one ruler mentioned on the stela, Nun Yax Ahiin, is known to
          have had strong connections with Teotihuacan. So it would not be
          strange that the city is mentioned on this stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ortega, Vergara, and del Castillo have also proved that the phenomenon
          depicted in the Xolotl is an actual event that occurs when the sun
          sets on the 21st of February and the 21st of October. These authors
          have made several other measurements, suggesting that Teotihuacan was
          planned around solar events. But why do we today know the site as
          Teotihuacan and not Teohuacan? Ortega means that this is due to the
          sun being a symbol of rulers and power within Aztec society. The Aztec
          rulers went to Teotihuacan on pilgrimage to assert their authority and
          connection to the sun. But by changing the meaning of the site from
          this place of rulers to a place of worship and religion, they could
          move the political center to Tenochtitlan.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think it's fair to point out that this is just an initial
          publication published in 2022. But it's interesting nonetheless and
          could lead to a new way of looking at the site. It will undoubtedly be
          interesting to see how this develops and where it will lead. This is
          an excellent example of what happens if you start asking the proper
          questions and not blaming aliens or lost Atlanteans for everything.

          Welcome to Peru, where we will look at number eight on the Ancient
          Alien list of pyramids. What is it we're going to find here?
        </p>
        <p>
          "<em
            >The Lambayeque Valley. Northern Peru. 1988. Explorer Thor Heyerdahl
            investigates what appears to be an area of large, earthen hills, but
            soon discovers that these hills are, in fact, massive adobe brick
            pyramids, severely eroded over the centuries. This was the site of a
            culture called the Sic√°n, and these people, who rose around 750 AD,
            seemed to be absolutely obsessed with the creation of pyramids. In
            fact, they created as many as 250 within this valley alone. And in
            one particular town, they created 26</em
          >."
        </p>
        <p>
          We have looked at pyramids in Peru previously; back in episode 44, we
          discussed the pyramids built by the Caral-Supe people. The Caral-Supe
          civilization, dating back to around 3100 BCE, is remarkable for its
          architectural feats, including pyramid-like structures and platform
          mounds similar to those in Bandurria, appearing around 2500 BCE. The
          most notable site, the city of Caral, is believed to have housed
          around 3000 people at its peak. Among its fascinating discoveries is a
          platform pyramid featuring an oval theater, where unique musical
          instruments made from condor and pelican bones were found, and
          intriguingly, blue whale vertebrae were used as stools.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a couple of issues with the part we heard from the show. It
          is correct that the Sican culture was settled in the Lambayeque
          Valley. Still, we might have to cover some chronology to get a better
          picture. Sican was not the first culture in the area; before them, we
          have the Moche culture, which was phased out around 700 CE. Then we
          have early Sican between 700 CE to about 900 CE, then we have middle
          Sican that took place 900 CE and then changed to late Sican around
          1100 CE. To make things a bit more complicated, there is a discussion
          if Sican culture and Lambayeque should be viewed as one or two
          distinct cultures. So, some archaeologists will talk only about the
          Lambayeque or only about the Sican. Some will refer to the culture
          with both names. This is something that I just want to highlight if
          you want to go out and learn more about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing with the Moche people is that they built adobe brick
          pyramids before the Sican culture entered the scene. So, these 250
          pyramids were not created only by the Sican/Lambayeque culture since
          the Moche sites were reused in later periods. Most of the Sican
          monumental buildings were made during the middle Sican period,
          starting around 900 CE. An interesting study on the DNA of the Sican
          people indicates that they moved into the area and, in a way, replaced
          the Moche settlements. Worth noting here is that some of the Moches
          settlements had, at this point, already been abandoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we know about the Middle Sican culture is that it was a
          hierarchical society. This can be seen through the graves where people
          of lower status often have simple graves. In contrast, the elite has
          elaborate grave goods in shaft tombs beneath mounds. We also have
          evidence of human sacrifice, but that might not have been as bloody as
          we usually picture these practices. Donnan and Cordy-Donnins are
          describing a sacrificial temple in Dos Cabezas. Within this temple,
          there were found 8 burials of humans that were sacrificed: seven women
          and one man. But it was not only the amount and quality of grave goods
          that were interesting but also the method by which these victims were
          killed. They were all strangled; we know that due to the ropes of fine
          and soft cotton were still around their necks. Donnan and
          Cordy-Donnins wrote, "<em
            >Although they (ed. the ropes) would have been very effective for
            strangulation, they were soft enough to have minimized cutting or
            bruising of the flesh. The intent may have been to terminate the
            lives of these individuals in the gentlest manner possible.</em
          >" What's also interesting is the bird motifs within the burials and
          temples. According to Shimada et al. and other researchers in the
          field, there are later prehispanic myths regarding the creation of
          different casts from eggs and stars. While we are not sure these myths
          existed back then, a connection could be argued. But at the end of the
          day, most of the religion is lost to history.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for Thor Heyerdahl being the discoverer of the pyramids, it is a
          bit of an after-construction. It's correct that Heyerdahl participated
          in the excavation with Daniel Sandweiss and Alfredo Narvaez, but the
          adobe pyramids were not new. Detailed info about the adobe pyramids
          had started to become public after excavations by Cavallaro and
          Shimada in 1981, a few years before Heyerdahl's project in Tucume.
          That said, Sandweiss and Narvaez could add much good information about
          the Lambayeque culture. Ancient Aliens brings up this project due to
          Heyerdahls' hyper-diffusion theories. While Heyerdahl was correct in
          that there was contact between Polynesia and South America, his idea
          of a white culture-bearer race creating culture and civilization is
          yet to be proven. Ioannidis et al. 2020 study does not show in what
          direction the travels took place; it could be that the Polynesians
          went to Peru and brought people back.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the excavation in Tucume, a relief was discovered depicting
          birdmen. Heyerdahl claimed that this was evidence of contact between
          Tucume and Rappanui. The similarities are very superficial when we
          look closer at the birdmen on Rappanui and what we find in Peru.
          According to the ancient Astronaut theory, however, birdmen are
          primitive people's way of depicting aliens. Something as silly as it
          sounds. People have always incorporated elements they find around them
          in their religion; ancient astronaut theorists only claim that the
          things they need to be real are real. They don't claim that the
          shapeshifting jaguars depicted in other places are real. And what does
          the theory say about the sheep bird figurines in Georgia, the country,
          not the state? Where were sheep flying around in prehistoric Georgia?
          Nobody would make this claim, but it is, in fact, what the
          pseudo-historians are doing here.

          We must push deep into the Peten jungles of Guatemala to get to number
          seven on the list. Located seven kilometers from the Mexican borders
          is a pre-classic Maya society that was swallowed by the jungle and
          lost in time. In 1926, the ruins of this enormous city were first
          reported. In 1930, Percy Madeira Jr. took the first photos of the
          overgrown temples from the air. Ian Graham was the first to officially
          survey and map the center of the site. Being on the ground, he could,
          by looking at pottery shards and sculptures, clearly see that this was
          a pre-classic Mayan site, something that at first was questioned by
          another archaeologist. However, excavations starting in 1978 would
          change this, lasting for four years. The excavation led by Ray Matheny
          and Bruce Dahlin would be able to add a lot of new information about
          the site. With C14 and other dating methods, they could date the site
          to at least 600 BCE, confirming Graham's initial pre-classic
          estimation.

          El Mirador is one of the oldest pre-classic Maya sites and by far the
          largest city of its time, making its contemporary neighbors look
          relatively insignificant. A giant causeway leading north toward what
          would later become a city of equal grandeur during the classic era,
          Calakmul. Another causeway leads southeast to the neighboring town of
          Nakbe. El Mirador seems to be a hub for several causeways, indicating
          they relied heavily on trade. We have seen in the archaeological
          records that luxury items from far away were imported and traded
          within the city. With the indulgence of such rare finery, El Mirador
          was clearly a hierarchical society. But as Matheny and Matheny wrote,
          "<em
            >it is not clear whether El Mirador, as a Late Preclassic polity,
            may have represented a city state, a territorial state, or even a
            regional state.</em
          >" James Doyle suggests that religion most likely held these early
          cities in the Maya lowlands together. These early centers revolved
          around monumental religious and ceremonial centers where the elite
          could separate themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          El Mirador has two of these centers, and as we learn from the Ancient
          Astronaut theorists, "On e's<em>
            called El Tigre. The other one's called La Danta. La Danta is 70
            meters tall. That's one of the tallest in the entire world. And it's
            so massive that, when you get to the top of its first basal
            platform, there's enough space where they put three more pyramids in
            a triad form on top of it.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          At 72 meters, La Dantas is monumental, but it's almost half the size
          of Khufu's pyramid in Giza. I also don't want you to picture a true
          pyramid here because it's far from the case. La Danta consists of
          several platforms. First, we have the base, which is 330 meters long,
          280 meters wide, and 10 meters high. Then, follow the most significant
          part that leads to a second platform where we find the most essential
          triad in the complex. This type of tirad construction was influential
          in this society, and El Mirador was exceptional with their
          constructions of these. They can often be found several times in the
          same complex. This, combined with the masks accompanying these
          temples, seems to indicate a shared monumentalisation of gods since
          these masks seem to be shared across both distances and generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;In la Danta, excavations have revealed a stucco facade that many
          believe is one of the earliest depictions of Popul Vuh. A story we
          spend quite some time with in episode 28. But it's one of the most
          iconic Mayan mythologies that was extremely important and influential
          in Mayan society. We see that the story already in the pre-classic
          times is exciting and shows how long this story has been a
          considerable part of the religious and secular society. But instead of
          talking about this vital influence, the Ancient Astronaut claims that
          these are aliens since they look like floating. I was disappointed
          when I realized this was why we were here: they interpreted an
          artistic representation of Popul Vuh as being weightless in space.
          It's so poorly argued that I'm at a loss for words. I don't want to
          stoop to their level, but the only thing I can come up with is
          "computer says no."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, they try to make things worse. "In Maya the word Xibalba means
          the Underworld. But some have suggested that the word Xibalba doesn't
          necessarily mean Underworld, but the Milky Way."
        </p>
        <p>
          So here we have a case of mixing different elements into a new
          narrative that fits better with the Ancient Alien idea. Let's start
          with the meaning of Xibalba, the show even gives us the true meaning,
          the Kitche Maya word for Underworld. As a noun or an adjective,
          Xibibal, it can be used to mean dangerous or frightening. In Yucatan
          Maya, this place is called Metnal and translates to the Underworld, a
          place of hardship, darkness, hunger, and cold. Something that fits
          with the Mayan idea of where the dead went is associated with caves
          and crevices underground. Right, it does not make sense that Xibalba
          would refer to space. That part is from a different aspect from the
          mythology. I'm quoting Almere Read and Gonz√°lez book "<em
            >Handbook of Mesoamerican Mythology</em
          >" here. "<em
            >For many, the Milky Way was a celestial path made either of clouds
            lit by the night sky, or water flowing like a great celestial river.
            In one Classic Maya myth carved on bone, the Milky Way in its
            east-west position became a canoe carrying the Maize God into the
            Underworld.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          Note here that the Milky Way is not the Underworld but a path towards
          it. Ancient Alien proponents have just removed the part where it was
          viewed as a pathway or canoe and claimed it to be another word for
          Xibalba. The pseudoscientists also like to draw a connection between
          the three hearthstones that are often connected to the place of
          creation. This was in what we know today in the Orion constellation.
          So it's claimed by the late Philip Coppens the Orion belt is the
          origin of creation and home of the aliens. That's why the people of
          ancient times built the pyramids in the same formation as the Orion
          belt if you move things around a little bit. The issue with these
          claims is that the stars that were connected to the hearthstones of
          creations in Maya mythology were Alnitak, Saiph, and Rigel. If you
          know your stars, you know that only one is part of the belt: Alnitak,
          Alnilam, and Mintaka.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three hearthstones were placed by the Maize God, and the first
          fire was drilled with, you know, a wooden bow and a stick. Not really
          alien technology here. And is it extraordinary that the Maya would use
          some of the brightest stars to incorporate into their mythology?
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Now, let's leave the Americas and head to the land of olives,
          wine, and pyramids.

          We are now back in Europe looking for pyramids and will not go where
          you might suspect. It's weirdly not the Bosnian pyramids; maybe it's
          because they are just hills, as we discussed previously, but we will
          find the next pyramid in Greece.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;"<em
            >Argos, Greece. Just outside this ancient city stands a mysterious
            stone structure known as the Pyramid of Hellinikon. It is the only
            pyramid in Europe recognized by mainstream archaeologists.</em
          >"
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;So, this segment starts with a massive error. While Europe might
          not be famous for its pyramids, they're not unheard of. Suppose we
          exclude modern creations like the Falicon pyramid in France, most
          likely created by Napoleon's veterans from Egypt, and Balmoral cairns
          in Scotland. In that case, we do have two locations with actual
          pyramids. One is, as we just heard, Hellinikon. The other is actually
          in Rome. The pyramid of Cestius is an impressive 125 Roman feet, or
          using metrics, less impressive 39 meters tall. This was a tomb built
          for Gaius Cestius between 18 to 12 BCE. So, Europe has at least two
          pyramids, according to mainstream archaeologists. Take that, Ancient
          Aliens. And to give the Ancient Aliens their point back, the pyramid
          in Hellinikon isn't really a pyramid; it's more like a hut with
          inward-sloping walls. So, it does not share anything with the pyramids
          in Egypt or those we have seen in America.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;In this part, we have a first for Ancient Aliens; they actually
          give us their sources. The first isn't really impressive, but an
          article, if we stretch the definition a bit, from Mysteries Unsolved.
          Guess everything can be unsolved if you don't really try. The second
          source, however, is a 1997 paper by Theocaris, Liritzis, and Galloway
          called "<em
            >Dating of two Hellenic Pyramids by a Novel Application of
            Thermoluminescence.</em
          >" They even show the paper in the episode.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;Right, so what is <em>Thermoluminescence</em>?</p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Let's lighten up our knowledge with something called
          thermoluminescence dating. Sounds like a mouthful, right? But stick
          with me; it's actually pretty fascinating!
        </p>
        <p>
          First off, let's break down the name. 'Thermo' means heat, and
          'luminescence'? That's a fancy word for light. So, Thermoluminescence
          ‚Äì or TL for short ‚Äì is all about 'light from heat.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, imagine you're a detective, but instead of solving crimes, you're
          uncovering the age of ancient pottery, bricks, or even sediments.
          That's where TL dating comes into play. It's like a time machine for
          archaeologists and geologists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's how it works: Over time, minerals in these materials absorb
          radiation from their surroundings. This radiation creates trapped,
          'excited' electrons in the material. Think of these electrons as tiny
          dancers waiting for their cue to perform.
        </p>
        <p>
          When scientists heat up an artifact, these electrons get the signal to
          dance ‚Äì or, in scientific terms, they release energy in the form of
          light. The amount of light released tells us how long those electrons
          have been chilling out, trapped in the material. And voila! By
          measuring this light, we can calculate the age of the artifact.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's the cool part: Thermoluminescence dating doesn't just tell
          us how old something is. It also reveals secrets from the past, like
          how people lived, what they made, and even when a volcanic eruption
          happened!
        </p>
        <p>
          But what is it this paper suggests, then? "The results suggest that
          the pyramid was built around 2730 BC, roughly 2,000 years before the
          rise of the Greek Empire. This was a structure that is very
          mysterious. It was constructed by a completely unknown culture."
        </p>
        <p>
          Criticism has been raised toward the study, among others, by Mary
          Lefkowitz in the chapter she wrote in "Archaeological Fantasies."
          While Thermoluminescence or TL is a great tool, especially for
          ceramics, it has its flaws. In the study, as Lefkowitz points out, the
          authors do not account for the stones being reused from an earlier
          construction. They also ignore previous research that has been done on
          the site. For example, they don't mention Louis Lord's excavation in
          the 1930s; Lords dated the structures due to the polygonal masonry and
          the pottery to around the fourth century BCE. The oldest pottery in
          the construction was no older than 500 BCE. Helena Fracchia also
          surveyed the site for pottery in 1980, and the earliest date was
          around 350 BCE.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1970, Mark Munn suggested that these sloping wall buildings were
          farm structures made out of wood or maybe brick to accommodate ladders
          to reach higher floors. This idea later seems to have been supported
          by Fracchia's research and later finds of sloping wall structures in
          Crimea that have been connected to ancient farms, which further
          appears to support Munn's idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also want to stress that no burial has ever been found in the
          structure at Hellinikon. It's also built more as a hut than these
          megalithic religious and burial structures we see elsewhere.
          Theocaris, Liritzis, and Galloway's studies also aim to prove a
          connection between these structures and Ancient Egypt. Something they
          don't really do nor successfully prove that these really are pyramids.
          We should also be cautious regarding the fantastic date, especially
          since no other archaeological evidence at the site seems to fit with
          these dates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if these are not pyramids, they are still exciting structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have covered five pyramids, or maybe four pyramids and one barn.
          Next time we meet, we will discuss the top five pyramids. That will,
          however, be in a different year.
