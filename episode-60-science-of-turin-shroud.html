          Welcome to Digging Up Ancient Aliens. This is the podcast where we
          examine strange claims about alternative history and ancient aliens in
          popular media. Do their claims hold water to an archeologist, or are
          there better explanations out there?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          We are now on episode 60, and I am Fredrik, your guide into the world
          of pseudo-archaeology. We are going to continue the investigation on
          the Turin Shroud, and this is the second part of it. In this case, Iâ€™d
          actually recommend you go back and listen to the first part before
          listening to this one. Last time, we looked at the history of the
          Shroud of Turin, and today, we will look at the scientific side of the
          fabric.&nbsp;

          >, we looked at the history of the shroud. From its sudden appearance
          in France to its early hoax accusation, its near destruction, and how
          it ended up in Turin. We also looked at the other shrouds of Jesus
          around Europe. While a good case can be made based solely on the
          history of the Shroud of Turin, is there any scientific evidence that
          the shroud is authentic? According to people like John de Salvo, there
          is.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The shroud has been studied by some of the top scientists and
          researchers in the world. And with all the scientific knowledge and
          equipment, we still do not know how the image of the shroud was
          produced"â€”John de Salvo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, if you encounter stories about the cloth in the media, it's
          due to some proclaimed new scientific evidence. So, let's pretend that
          de Charny got the fabric in the Holy Land and smuggled it back to
          France. What is the scientific evidence, and does it hold up? Before
          we get into all of this, we will ask a pretty relevant question that
          we maybe even should have started with before talking about the
          history of the Turin Shroud. Would we expect to find a burial linen
          like this in a first-century Jewish burial? Remember, Jesus was Jewish
          and, due to this, would have been buried according to the customs.
          Because by

            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Ian Hodder</span> </a
          >, we will cram some archaeology into this episode.
        </p>
        <h2 id="burials">Archaeology of Jewish Burial Tradition</h2>
        <p>
          What would a typical Second Temple burial look like? To be as precise
          as possible, we will hone in on the period from 100 BCE to about 100
          CE. As usual, the answer will, of course, depend on whether you are
          rich or poor. Parts of our evidence of the burial practices come from
          historical sources like rabbinical records and Josephus's writings.
          However, we also have archaeological records from Jerusalem and more
          from Jerico's salvage excavations.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeologists have excavated Koch tombs in the necropolis of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeriko">
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Jerico</span> </a
          >. Koch tombs are a type of burial complex with narrow shafts.
          According to Hachlili and Killebrew, within Jerico, we often find a
          central room with a lowered floor and narrow loculi tombs on each of
          the three walls opposite the entrance. These were family tombs and
          were used by several generations. This type was also widespread within
          the Semitic world, and we find them in places with Jewish colonies.
          While these tombs are not known to have been decorated or painted,
          Hachlili and Killebrew have found evidence of at least one example of
          a complex decorated with paintings of wines. This tomb dates to the
          first century CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a primary burial, we see that the deceased were carried inside the
          tomb in their coffin. When placed in the coffin, the caretaker seems
          to have put much effort into straightening the person's limbs. They
          all lay on their backs with their hands to the side of the body, and
          often, the head is to the side. The coffins were made of wood and held
          together by wooden plugs; metal seems to have been used chiefly for
          decorations. Inside, we have examples of the deceased being placed
          upon a sort of stick-filled leather mattress. The question is why, and
          a possible explanation could be that the person died at home on the
          mattress, and instead of burning it due to becoming unclean, it was
          placed with the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hear you; you want to know if we have examples of imprints of woven
          material. Bar-Adon mentions, for example, a bulrush impression in a
          tomb in En el-Ghuweir by the Dead Sea. Reading the Talmud, we get
          hints of reed mats used in burials for the poor. However,
          <a

          indicate that a cloth was used; the material is not specified. It
          could, as accounts like Bar-Adon, Hachlili, and Killebrew suggest, be
          the case that they used prayer shawls with the fringes cut or even
          woven shrouds.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="crucifixion">Can a crucified person be buried?</h2>
        <p>
          Would a crucified person have been allowed to be buried according to
          Jewish custom? That's a great question and a really important one for
          our investigation. The first thing we might have to settle is that
          Jesus would not have been executed by the Jews but by the Romans.
          While he, in part, was convicted by the council of
          <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin">
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Sanhedrin</span> </a
          >, it was ultimately the Romans and Pontious Pilate who convicted
          Jesus of crimes against the state. This is something to have in mind
          when proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Bible, it's said that
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Joseph-of-Arimathea"
          >
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Joseph of Arimathea</span>
          </a>
          took care of Jesus' body and arranged for its burial. As Bart Ehrman
          points out, this narrative has a couple of issues. In the earliest
          account of this story, Mark, we learn that Joseph of Arimathea is a
          respected council member. This is the same council of Sanhedrin that
          all previously agreed to find evidence that would result in the death
          of Jesus. Mark is unmistakable in that all council members agreed to
          this plan. Isn't it a bit strange that Joseph of Arimathea would
          suddenly have this change of heart? It could be explained by later
          Gospel traditions that would try to find some heroes among the
          villains. Mark seems to build on an even earlier account that we can
          see remains of in
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bible.com/bible/111/ACT.13.NIV">
            <span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204)">Acts 13:28-29</span> </a
          >. This verse says that the whole council took him down from the tree
          or cross and arranged for Jesus' funeral. But Mark then changed this
          to be a named council man who, in the later gospels, would turn into
          an up till then anonymous follower. If we look at other accounts like
          the Corinthians, Paul seems unaware of the name of the person who
          buried Jesus.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But for the sake of argument, let's assume Joseph of Arimathea was a
          wealthy follower. Would Pilate have allowed Joseph to take Jesus' body
          for burial? The sources agree that the answer would have been no. Some
          apologists claim that Jesus had to be taken down due to the impending
          Sabbath, but the Romans would not care for this tradition. The whole
          point of crucifixion was to humiliate and set an example. Remember,
          Jesus was not convicted for breaking Jewish law but for creating a
          disorder in the Roman empire. He was sentenced as an enemy of the
          state. In the Annals of Tacitus, we can read in Book 6 and Chapter 29
          that it was preferred to die by one hand than by execution. As Tacitus
          puts it, "the fact that a man legally condemned forfeited his estate
          and was debarred from burial." While a criminal dying by suicide
          instead had his will and funerary respected. This notion is supported
          by other authors and texts, such as the criminals sitting on the cross
          as food for the scavengers. At a later point, the remains would be
          collected and put in a communal pit at the execution place. The whole
          point of the crucifixion was to make a very vocal, humiliating, and
          violent point. People should look at it and think twice about becoming
          rabble-rousing insurgents.
        </p>
        <p>
          So would Pontus Pilate, with this in mind, allow Jesus a proper
          burial? Our accounts of him historically portray him as a rather stern
          ruler. He had people beaten up and killed for protesting and seemed to
          have cared little about Jewish customs or superstitions. So that he
          suddenly would honor the burial practices for someone from a
          noninfluential family and an enemy of the state, nonetheless, is
          strange. Some proponents of this narrative will point to history,
          claiming that it did happen that the Romans would allow crucified
          people to be taken down and buried. They might also point toward a
          secondary burial found in Jerusalem. A secondary burial in this
          context is that the bones were found in an ossuary. Within this
          ossuary or box of bones, archaeologists found evidence of a crucified
          person. We know this since the nail is still stuck in the heel bone.
          It most likely hit a knot in the wood, making it hard for the person
          taking this individual down to remove the nail. Instead, the nail was
          sawed off and remained lodged in the calcaneus.
        </p>
        <p>
          While to some extent true, the statement does not really represent
          what is known about the practice. We can, for example, look at the
          writing of Philo, a Jewish philosopher in Alexandria. In his work
          "Against Flaccus" he writes that:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Rulers who conduct their government as they should and do not pretend
          to honour but do really honour their benefactors make a practice of
          not punishing any condemned person until those notable celebrations in
          honour of the birthdays of the illustrious Augustan house are over. I
          have known cases when on the eve of a holiday of this kind, people who
          have been crucified have been taken down and their bodies delivered to
          their kinsfolk, because it was thought well to give them burial and
          allow them the ordinary rites. For it was meet that the dead also
          should have the advantage of some kind treatment upon the birthday of
          the emperor and also that the sanctity of the festival should be
          maintained."
        </p>
        <p>
          As we see in the quote, it was expected during some particular
          festivities that executions and punishments were postponed for the
          duration. As Philo says, this was during the emperor's birthday in
          particular. So, the practice was only used in a minimal capacity and
          did not really fit with the execution of Jesus. So, taken to its
          extreme, John Crossan, Jesus would have been left on the cross for the
          scavengers and animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, from what we have gathered so far, a rock tomb would not be out of
          the question for a rich person. A buried person would likely have been
          swept in some sort of cloth. The issue is that many things would talk
          against Jesus being allowed down. Also, as Jodi Magness put it,
          nothing stopped Joseph of Arimathea from removing Jesus after the
          Sabbath to another tomb without Joseph's family members in it.
          Remember, these rock-hewn tombs would have been family tombs used for
          generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's again say that Jesus was allowed down and swept with a
          cloth. Is this cloth of the correct period? There are a few ways to
          find this out, and the first would be to look at the weaving of the
          fabric.

          Unfortunately, Jerusalem's climate is not great for preserving
          fabrics. This is due to the high humidity in the area, which means
          that we don't have a large selection of preserved textiles. Luckily, a
          few have been preserved to our day that we can use and compare to the
          Shroud of Turin. Something worth noting is that the largest fragment
          we have preserved is about 16 by 12 centimeters. Compare this to the
          4.4-meter-long shroud preserved in full.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what do we know about fabrics we have found from the second temple
          period? First of all, many of these fabrics seem to be unbleached
          linen. Then, we often have something that is overlooked in this
          discussion: the spinning method. I had no idea that there are two
          dominant methods within the spinning of yarn and thread, the Z twist
          and the S twist. The twist refers to the direction the fibers go and
          will affect what the thread and yarn will be most beneficial
          for.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If you hold up a thread or a string of yarn and the fibers seem to
          spiral upward in the same direction as the central part of an S, then
          we have an S twist. Basically, the fibers angle upward, leaning left
          to right. But if the fibers appear to spiral in the direction of the
          diagonal part of a Z, we have the Z twist. Meaning the fibers angle
          upward from right to left instead. In Israel and Palestina, during the
          second temple period, all linen fabrics found are spun with an S
          twist. A few wool textiles have been found with a Z twist, but these
          seem to have been imported from either Rome or Greece, who, during
          this era, spun their fabrics with the Z twist. The Z twist would not
          become standard in Israel and Palestine until after the Middle
          Ages.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So let's look at the Shroud of Turin then. What method was used to
          create the thread? The cloth uses a Z-spun thread with a 1/3
          herringbone twill pattern. As mentioned, all linen threads were spun
          with an S-pattern using a plain weave tabby. Orit Shamir, a curator of
          Organic Materials for the Israel Antiquities Authority, points out
          that a herringbone twill was not found in textiles in this part of the
          world until way after the Middle Ages. The thread count in the Turin
          Shroud is about 38,6 threads per centimeter on the warp or diagonal
          threads. It's 25.7 at the weft, or horizontal thread. This is a high
          thread count, especially when we compare this to the standard fabric
          in the region, with 10-15 threads per centimeter at the warp and 15-20
          at the weft.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what does all of this mean for the shroud? Orit Shamir put it
          pretty simply. The Turin Shroud would not have been manufactured in
          Israel or Palestine, nor would it have been imported, indicating a
          medieval date for the creation of the cloth. Everything in the
          creation of the fabric seems to point toward a medieval date somewhere
          in Europe.

          Not everyone agrees with this conclusion, and this is one of these
          cases where Sindonology shows an exciting crossover with Alternative
          Historians and Ancient Aliens. Like those promoting the Ancient
          Astronaut idea start with their conclusion and work backward, so do
          Sindonologists. Giulio Fanti, an engineering professor, claims in his
          paper, "<em>Why is the Turin Shroud Authentic?</em>" that the Z-twist
          would indicate it was for a high-ranking priest. Why this would be or
          where he got this from is not mentioned. Nor is this backed up by
          other textile archaeology or history. While the Tora is quite precise
          in how things should be made, the twilling pattern is not mentioned.

          Orthodox Jews, and the production of the Tallit is an example.
          Furthermore, the priest's clothes could not be sewn, meaning the
          fabric had to be woven in one piece. So, you could not go and pick up
          a piece of cloth at the market and use it for your priestly
          attire.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Giulio Fanti also claims the cloth originates from India. Basing the
          claim not on archaeological or textile evidence from the era. Instead,
          use a paper on DNA found on the Turin Shroud published by Gianni
          Barcaccia et al. in 2015. The paper tries to trace the origin of the
          DNA found on the shroud of Turin, but its conclusion is a bit
          lackluster. As expected from being touched and handled by an unknown
          amount of people through the centuries. While much of what they found
          originates in Europe and the Middle East, they also found traces from
          South America and India. While the authors acknowledge that the
          American contribution might be later contaminated, it's not discussed
          in the other sources. The authors also speculate that the Indian DNA
          on the Turin Shroud comes from the one who created the cloth. Ignoring
          other sources of contamination, while only 2% of modern India is
          catholic, it still accounts for some 20 million people.

        <p>
          I've also been unable to locate this trade mentioned in Giulio Fanti's
          paper. What I do find is later import as described by Hillebrandt in
          the 6th and 9th centuries in the Early Islamic era. Orit Shamir's
          statement that the import of this type of textile was not present
          around the first century CE is holding up based on all the available
          evidence.&nbsp;

          While discussing Jewish second-temple burials and the Shroud of Turin,
          a claim that occasionally arises is that coins are depicted on the
          shroud. These coins are claimed to have been minted during Puntius
          Pilate's reign. This opens up a couple of questions for us. Would a
          Jewish person have been buried with coins during the first century CE?
          And can we really see these coins represented on the shroud?
        </p>
        <p>
          Jackson, Jumper, Moltern, and Stevenson claimed that coins were
          visible where the eyes were in 1977, based on a 3D picture they
          created. This was elaborated on by Virginia Bortin in 1980, who
          claimed that coins over the eyes were a common practice among Jews.
          This claim is not reflected in the understanding of the Second Temple
          burial practices either then or now. Hachlili and Killebrew elaborate
          on the coins found in burials in their 1983 paper; coins are rare in
          general. However, there are a few examples where coins were placed in
          the deceased's mouth. Two tombs in Jerico have been found with coins
          placed in this manner. As for coins being put over the eyes, only one
          example has been found. As Hachlili and Killebrew respond to William
          Meacham, this is far from enough to claim that this was a widespread
          practice. Israeli archeologist Levi Rahmani raises another question,
          why would coins by Pontius Pilate be put over the eyes of someone who
          was put to death by Pilate? While there is one known case, the coin
          over the eyes would be a foreign practice and not in line with the
          funeral mentioned in<span style="color: rgb(14, 16, 26)"></span>

        </p>
        <p>
          As for our second question, are the coins really visible? The answer
          is no. It's one of those cases where you will start seeing patterns if
          you look at random noise long enough. Basically, it's a Rocharch test
          but with a claimed divine twist. Recent tests performed in 2011 and
          published by Salvatore Lorusso et al. confirm that no coins are
          visible based on modern image analysis.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we have Fanti, a name we will frequently encounter, with a
          different numismatic approach. Instead of looking at potential coins
          represented on the Turin Shroud, he compares the artist's renditions
          of Jesus on coins to the image we see on the shroud. While a novel
          idea, he is cherrypicking data, trying to get the narrative to fit his
          preferred conclusion. Nothing also stops the coins from spreading; one
          of these Byzantine coins with a Jesus motif was found in the<span

          Is there anything else we can look at to see when and how the cloth
          was created? Maybe a method that takes place in a lab setting? Luckily
          for us, there is, and our first method is a good old carbon 14 dating.
        </p>
        <h2 id="c14turinshroud">C14 dating the Shroud of Turin</h2>
        <p>
          Before we get into the tests and the debate that has raged ever since
          we should look at how the tests were made and by whom. Radiocarbon
          dating has been around since the 1940s. While discussions regarding
          having the shroud tested started quite early, the methods avalible
          would require a rather large piece to give a decent result. As the
          technology improved, the question regarding the Turin Shroud age came
          up again. In 1970, the Roman Catholic Church put together a group of
          scientists who were responsible for the tests. In 1978, the Shroud of
          Turin Research Project, or S.Tu.R.P, was formed and originally had 33
          members. While they all had a scientific background, none had any
          experience in archaeology, textiles, art history, or history. They
          were also religious; while this doesn't make you a better or worse
          scientist, it does throw a bit of the neutrality into question.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group put together a testing protocol that was quite scientific;
          this was though stopped by the Catholic Church. The original protocol
          included blind tests and other examples of a sound scientific
          approach. The final protocol went as this:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The laboratories at Oxford, ZÃ¼rich, and Tucson would perform the
            test;
          </li>
          <li>
            They would each receive one sample weighing 40 mg, sampled from a
            single portion of weave;
          </li>
          <li>
            The laboratories would each receive two control samples, clearly
            distinguishable from the shroud sample;
          </li>
          <li>
            Samples would be delivered to the laboratories' representatives in
            Turin;
          </li>
          <li>Each test would be filmed;</li>
          <li>
            There would be no comparison of results (nor communication) between
            laboratories until the results are certified as definitive,
            univocal, and complete;
          </li>
          <li>
            The proportional counter method would not be used because it
            required gram quantities rather than milligram quantities of shroud
            material.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The result was published 1989 in Nature, giving a calibrated date of
          1273â€“1288 CE with 68% confidence and a calibrated date of 1262â€“1312 CE
          and 1353â€“1384 CE with 95% confidence. Giulio Fanti claims in a paper
          that these dates are widely contested, citing only his own papers. But
          sindonologists have contested these results ever since for a variety
          of creative reasons. These range from the specific part used was a
          medieval repair, contaminated by smoke from fire, bacteria, etc. None
          have been able to show that this is the case yet, and they are either
          highly unrealistic or based on data misuse.
        </p>
        <p>
          A recent approach is to cast doubt on the C14 tests using statistics.
          While Andres Christen published a paper in 1994 that showed that the
          tests were statistically accurate, other authors used a different
          approach. A 2020 paper by Bryan Walsh and Larry Schwalbe claims the
          tests lack statistical heterogeneity in the Turin Shrouds data. These
          claims are not new, and as former editor of Nature Philipp Ball puts
          it, these papers don't show that the 1989 paper was inherently wrong.
          However, they show that the date itself is not conclusive. Here I
          agree with Walsh and Schwalbe, who suggest that more testing is
          needed. While these authors want to re-use the samples taken in 88, I
          would prefer that new samples were taken. This is to silence claims of
          repairs or other fringe ideas regarding the samples taken. I suspect
          that if the existing samples are re-tested with a similar date, this
          will just take us back to where we are now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternative non-intrusive dating methods have been suggested by
          sindonologists, such as vibrational spectroscopy. While this is a new
          and exciting way to date material in a non-destructive way, it still
          feels like it is in its infancy. I also noted some weird dates and
          calibrations. Baraldi and Tini pointed out in a 2015 presentation that
          the Turin Shroud with this method was dated to 300 BCE +/- 400 years
          and 200 BCE +/- 500 years. It's a very high uncertainty range for
          these tests. While it's a promising method, the dates for the Turin
          shroud still don't fit with a first-century date and the other
          archaeological records we have. Based on unspecified records, Fantini
          has since calibrated these dates to 400 CE with an uncertainty rate of
          500 years. Other authors, while being optimistic, point out that there
          are still a lot of unknowns with this method.
        </p>
        <h2 id="pollen">Pollen on the shroud</h2>
        <p>
          Another approach to dating and authenticating the Turin Shroud is
          pollen spores on the cloth. Swiss criminologist Max Frei-Sulzer
          claimed to have found 33 Middle Eastern pollen that would place the
          shroud in first-century Palestine. On top of this, Frei-Sulzer also
          contended that the pollen was from Edessa in Turkey and the Anatolian
          steppe. Why Edessa is named specifically due to sindonologists'
          attempts to connect the Turin Shroud with the shroud that was supposed
          to be located in the city, also known as the Mandylion. According to
          sindonologists, this would solve the origin of the Turin Shroud. As we
          mentioned last time, the Turin Shroud appeared one day in France, and
          no one connected to it could tell where it came from. This theory that
          the Turin Shroud is the Mandylion has then been disproven by Andrea
          Nicolotti.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let's return to the pollen samples. Micropaleontologist Steven D.
          Schafersman points out that it's a bit unlikely that 33 pollen species
          would make it to the cloth and that they are specifically from
          Palestine, Turkey, and Anatolia. Schafersman also points out that
          what's missing from the fabric is the most common species in the area;
          for example, no pollen from Olive trees can be found all over the
          region. That the winds would select only specific pollen from the
          different areas and collect them in a small area could be, as
          Schafersman suggests, a case of fraud. Or some particular divine
          pollen intervention.&nbsp;
        </p>

          Frei-Sulzer was also one of the scientists who claimed that the now
          infamous "Hitler diaries" were genuine. Walter Mcrone would later show
          that the pollen samples were doubtful after Frei-Sulzer died in 1993.
          Joe Nickell also points out that McCrone found that Frei-Sulzer
          several times had been found guilty by the Police in Switzerland of
          some artistic interpretations of criminal evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Later samples seem to have not been able to confirm this idea, as I
          mentioned earlier, with the DNA trace study done in 2015.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <h2 id="replicas">How was the Turin Shroud made?</h2>
        <p>
          But how was the Turin Shroud created then? In Ancient Aliens, we're
          told the following:&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "And in 2011, Italian scientists were able to prove that the Shroud of
          Turin was created by a supernatural flash of light, an unearthly flash
          of light. In my opinion, the Shroud of Turin is proof that Jesus
          transformed himself into a being of light, and projected himself
          through the Shroud of Turin."
        </p>
        <p>â€“ William Henry.</p>
        <p>
          This quote references a study by Paolo Di Lazzaro et al., that claims
          that the image we see on the Turin Shroud was achieved through a flash
          of UV light. The team behind the studies has not been able to produce
          a full body image on the textile, citing this as being due to
          limitations in the current technology. But like many other
          sindonologists, they claim that the image is impossible from the
          start, hinting that the only solution can be divine. The team also
          sets up strange limits on the criteria of what a replication must have
          to be viewed as a proper replication. For example, Di Lazzaro often
          claims that the coloration depth can't be deeper than 0,2 micrometers.
          This measurement is based on the paint that came off when a few pieces
          of sticky tape were put on the textile. But Di Lazzaro doesn't
          adequately explain why the pigments found on scotch tape would
          indicate the coloration depth. But this is used to rule out other
          recreations of the Turin Shroud that do not fit the preferred
          narrative of a divine creation.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Because other replications have been made. Joe Nickell, who we have
          mentioned before, replicated the image through a basic relief method
          in the 1970's. Nickell even appeared in the show "In Search of" to
          demonstrate how one could create a replica of the Shroud of Turin.
          Nickell created the copy by wrapping a wet cloth around a bas-relief
          sculpture and letting it dry. He then applied pigments on the textile
          to achieve the darker and lighter portions. Others have used this
          method with some variation to create other replicas of the
          shroud.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Other methods include a dust-transfer technique, as Craig and Bresee
          did in 1994. Luigi Garlaschelli replicated the image in 2009 using
          medieval methods and acid. That study was later criticized by Fanti
          and Di Lazzaro with their own limit of 0,2 micrometers as the main
          criticism.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          All three of these methods show that replicating the image isn't as
          tricky as the pro shroud crowd suggests it is. These methods also
          answer something the sindonologists fail to answer: a question I have
          as someone with long hair. Why is the hair hanging down in the shroud?
          This would not be the case if it was a natural person, but if it was a
          statue, this was based on. Well, then, it makes more sense. I also
          wonder why, on the one hand, the sindonologists claim the image can't
          be created by color pigments while, on the other hand, admitting that
          there are pigments throughout the cloth. Also worth mentioning is that
          the supposed blood on the fabric has failed forensic serological
          tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, where does this leave us? If we look at these points separately,
          they don't deny or confirm the Turin Shroud. But when we look at
          everything together as we should, the evidence for the shroud being a
          medieval hoax is somewhat overwhelming. We can't look at the evidence
          in a vacuum. Still, we need to put everything together and look at it
          with critical eyes. Something both sindonology and Ancient Aliens seem
          to struggle with.
